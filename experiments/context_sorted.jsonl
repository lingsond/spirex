{"pred": "According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it\u2019s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\" Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it\u2019s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon\u2019s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series. For the past couple of years, horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s series after another, with four core games, one RPG spinoff, and a novel released so far. The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months. Cawthon\u2019s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn\u2019t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn\u2019t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices. Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s games early, and it wouldn\u2019t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon\u2019s post to the contrary. With October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location\u2018s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more \"kid-friendly,\" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision.

{"pred": "In finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona\u2019s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges. In hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself \"America\u2019s toughest sheriff,\" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge. \u00a9 REUTERS/Laura Segall Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announces newly launched program aimed at providing security around schools in Anthem, Arizona, January 9, 2013. PHOENIX \u2014 A single word \u2014 \"intentionally\" \u2014 could transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution. The ruling Friday was one of Arpaio\u2019s most serious defeats, but it doesn\u2019t bar him from holding office, and he had already announced his intention to run for a seventh term as sheriff in November. In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio. In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice. Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order \"out of spite\" and had arrested 500 people. In Friday\u2019s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count. The ACLU, which brought the original case against Arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff\u2019s office. Arpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff\u2019s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined. In his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos. Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow\u2019s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio\u2019s violations of his orders were intentional. A lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow\u2019s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn\u2019t want to see Arpaio reelected. \"Strong remedies are needed to protect the community\u2019s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct,\" said Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \"Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.\" \"The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,\" Snow wrote. \"In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.\" Snow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives. Longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign. \"Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame,\" the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said in a statement Friday. He later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly. \"The Defendants\u2019 unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote."}
{"pred": "Here\u2019s how much you should be tipping your hairdresserMore Below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist \u2014 and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. Thank us later \u2014 no tip necessary. Remembering how much you\u2019re supposed to tip anywhere can be hard \u2014 what do current trends dictate? Is there such a thing as too much? And what if you got a discount on the service? But knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands. If you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you\u2019re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what\u2019s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment. As for your stylist\u2019s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20. Try to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it\u2019s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon. As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk! Finally, if you\u2019re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. If they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert Peggy Post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%. If you\u2019re a woman with shorter hair \u2014 meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly \u2014 your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client\u2019s. Offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along. Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon. \"All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,\" she told InStyle."}
{"pred": "How was it to reunite? Had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth \"Harry Potter\" movie? Which \"Potter\" co-star would you most like to reunite with? The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa. Rickman: No, because I think we\u2019d both been so busy doing other things. But it was great to see him on the set, and it was great to watch all three of them. I saw Emma [Watson] the other night in London in a restaurant, and I saw Daniel [Radcliffe] recently in London because he was doing a play. It\u2019s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image. Grint: I don\u2019t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it\u2019s very different. I wanted to just try it; it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I\u2019ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it\u2019s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I\u2019m enjoying it. Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint On 'CBGB,' Reuniting Post-'Potter' And Favorite Halloween Costumes Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie? Grint: Yeah, he has a cameo. He plays the cab driver. He was lovely. He was such a nice guy. I was kind of surprised he was still alive. Did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie? Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it. Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy? Once you started exploring the role and got into The Dead Boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? What did you think of the band you were portraying? Rickman: I wasn\u2019t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn\u2019t know about it and didn\u2019t know its history. I hadn\u2019t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it\u2019s all been a new discovery to me. Obviously I was aware of some of the bands, but not that they\u2019d all started in a club on the Bowery. Grint: I don\u2019t know, probably not. I\u2019ve tried to leverage it, but I just know it\u2019s never going to happen. \"CBGB\" is out in limited release now. Was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera? Grint: There are so many. All of them. I\u2019ve already loved working with them. I like Michael Gambon. He\u2019s so cool; just a remarkable guy. I\u2019ve worked with Julie Walters before as well. I love her, she\u2019s great. Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England. Do you have a favorite Halloween candy? Grint: I really love them. I listened to all their songs completely. Their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. But no, I really love then. I\u2019ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. To go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music. Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don\u2019t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that\u2019s a big thing. I\u2019ve tried that. That\u2019s pretty great. Not knowing much of the mythology of CBGB, how did you come to learn about your characters? Rickman: I suppose, in my perspective, I\u2019ve played as many of those as I have the other sort. It\u2019s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. I\u2019m perfectly happy to be Colonel Brandon in \"Sense & Sensibility\" as I am any of those powerful characters. It\u2019s just part of an actor\u2019s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard. Grint: I didn't actually know a lot about it. I'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on T-shirts and stuff like that, but I didn\u2019t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. I love Talking Heads, and the whole punk thing was something I really loved. So, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. And also Dead Boys, I wasn\u2019t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on YouTube was amazing. They just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. It was incredible. Rickman: I think every English actor is nervous of a Newcastle accent. That\u2019s really difficult. Grint: Weirdly, yeah. It didn\u2019t really feel that big a deal. It just kind of happened. I didn\u2019t really think about it when I was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. I had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail. And yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. There was quite a lot of that in the film. Especially from Justin [Bartha] as well. ... There\u2019s quite a lot of ass in the film. You had to try out an American accent in this role. Is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera? Grint: It\u2019s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. I like that kind of challenge. A couple years ago, I did a film that required me to do a Liverpool accent. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. It\u2019s quite a harsh sound. But I enjoy that side of things. Rickman: Obviously I was aware of the huge rise of The Police in England, and as an art student I was very much a fan of Talking Heads. And then Blondie, but I wasn\u2019t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. But of course I was also very much around the height of The Beatles and The Stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. And [Bob] Dylan, very much so. ... England in the \u201860s and the \u201870s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. One was very shaped by that. Of course. HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him. Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh? Grint: It was that whole era that I liked. I like, obviously, The Sex Pistols and The Clash, Blondie as well, and The Ramones. Some amazing people performed on that stage. ... I went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why I decided to do it, because I have such a love for that. The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB. Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others. Is music something you\u2019d ever pursue? Grint: [Laughs] No, not at all. The dog collar was a new experience for me. Grint: Not really, no, actually. ... I love Alan. He\u2019s always been one of my favorites. But yeah, it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because -- I\u2019m trying to think back -- I don\u2019t think I ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak. Now for something more fun. It's October. What's your favorite Halloween costume you've ever worn? Grint: Not so much notes. It was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. And he was such a nice guy and we had a good time. Alan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. What were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? Is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character? Did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point? Rickman: [Laughs] The thing about Halloween is, to me, it just means -- because it\u2019s so different in England \u2013- we used to have something called Bonfire Night, and we\u2019d have fireworks. That\u2019s disappeared and I know Halloween\u2019s taken over. Halloween to me as a child was, the family would fill a bowl of water and you\u2019d have apple bobbing in it, and you\u2019d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt. Did he give you any notes while filming? Grint: Yeah, there wasn\u2019t really a whole lot to go on. There are a few videos of him playing live at CBGB and a few interviews I watched. Yeah, and having [Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome] on set was quite a different thing. I had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you\u2019re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it\u2019s quite a challenge. What are you up to today? Grint: Yeah, I guess it was, yeah. Rickman: What I really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. Because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. Along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, I suppose. I watched old interviews and DVDs. I listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me. So he was on set the whole time? Were you comfortable with that? How did that go down? Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It\u2019s not very practical. Rickman: I don\u2019t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large."}

{"pred": "Sprite May Be The Best Hangover Cure, Chinese Researchers Say Do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by? Tell us below. Some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects. A group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of \"Sprite.\" The team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms. After examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms. To alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing Advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick. But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket? Most of us are familiar with the pounding headaches, drowsiness, stomach-turning nausea and \"did-I-get-run-over-by-a-bus\" sensation that comes with that most dreaded of morning-after ailments: the hangover. The researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. However, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet. On the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde. The Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH. Some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol\u2019s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body. Edzard Ernst, a medicinal science expert from the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results.

{"pred": "You Won\u2019t Believe This Stunning \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Revelation About Professor McGonagall From reading J.K. Rowling\u2018s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn\u2019t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga. It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration. After all, the Dark Lord was probably, \"angry, vindictive, and jealous of McGonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as \"what was rightfully his\". He was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. Just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between Harry Potter and himself throughout the entire saga. Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall\u2019s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor? As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall\u2019s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort\u2019s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle\u2019s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right. Obversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort\u2019s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from \u2018lasting more than a year\u2019. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term\u2019s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn\u2019t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn\u2019t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall\u2019s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there? Take note of Professor McGonagall\u2019s wand. It\u2019s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, \u2018the survivor\u2019s wand,\u2019 because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration."}

Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn\u2019t happening \u2013 so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions. Post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits \u2013 but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m too upset that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" won\u2019t have one. After all, they aren\u2019t exactly part of the franchise\u2019s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it\u2019s not a device that has to be used all over Hollywood. If everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it. In the modern blockbuster world, post-credits scenes have become very popular. The films made by Marvel Studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the \"X-Men\" franchise movies as well as the latest \"Terminator.\" Because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the \"Star Wars\" series as well... but now J.J. Abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation. \"No, there\u2019s not. All the scenes are actually in the movie.\""}

{"pred": "By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide. Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide. (CNN) After the first locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus were identified in a small area north of downtown Miami, officials began to spray an insecticide over a 10-square-mile portion of Miami-Dade County. But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work? Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions. Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees. The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide. The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight. \"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said. Yet some environmentalists are not OK with any effects to land and sea, he said. \"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department. In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment. \"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said. Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely. Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said. Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July. His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said. Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted. However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled. Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.

{"pred": "Have you ever wondered, \"Do birds fart?\" No? Well maybe now we\u2019ve sparked your curiosity. It\u2019s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components\u2014namely sulfur. So if birds don\u2019t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn\u2019t smell it. As far as we could tell, this isn\u2019t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab\u2019s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he\u2019s never personally noticed a bird fart. They don\u2019t fart\u2014detectably. There\u2019s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has ever truly observed\u2014or more importantly, measured\u2014a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate? Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird\u2019s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers. Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers. But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there\u2019s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected. As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don\u2019t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, he\u2019d be concerned something was wrong with the bird. But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air? In another blog post, she describes the only written account she\u2019s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master\u2019s thesis on blue jays. One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas. Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod\u2019s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor\u2014steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog\u2019s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)"}

{"pred": "The One Morning Work Mistake You Can't Recover From Bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this \"morning bias.\" The researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias. Rolling into the office around 9:30 a.m. every day may be killing your career, even if you stay late to put in a full day's worth of work. But the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done. This \"morning bias\" appears to be deeply ingrained. In a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like \"sunrise\") with words associated with conscientiousness (like \"industriousness\"). Past studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company. That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning. Although the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men. That's because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office. A new study from the University of Washington\u2019s Foster School of Business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later. Another recent study covered by the New York Times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more \"traditional\" hours. \"Most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation,\" Erin Kelly, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, told the Times. \"You are implicitly saying, \u2018Most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways.\u2019 And that is where you have this stigma or career penalties.\" In the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee\u2019s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings. In a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. The performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. Researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. \"It seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance,\" the three researchers wrote in a post for the Harvard Business Review."}

One Family\u2019s Journey After Giving Birth To Twin Micro-Preemies Sophie and Riley were born on October 2, 2012 nearly four months early. The babies were immediately whisked away and the twins themselves were separated. It took five hours to stabilize them, and both Edwyna and TJ were stunned they were borht still alive. Sophie and Riley were considered \"micro-preemies\" and suffered a slew of health issues, like chronic lung disease and holes in their hearts. Edwyna and TJ were so excited to start a family, but they had no idea it would lead them on journey of incredible odds. During an early ultrasound, the couple was even more thrilled to discover it was twins. Edwyna herself is a triplet, and one of her sisters already had twins. She understood firsthand the incredible bond between multiples. Riley was especially fragile, and was dealt one terrifying blow after another. This tiny little baby underwent four surgeries and faced a blocked intestine and bleeding ulcer. TJ whispered into his son\u2019s ear, telling him it was okay to let go if he needed to.

But beware, just hours after launch, it turns out iOS 9.3.2 is hiding a very nasty surprise indeed... So what happens now? I suspect Apple will make a statement about this sooner rather than later (I\u2019ve contacted the press team), and the two obvious paths are to a) Re-release a tweaked version of iOS 9.3.2 or b) quickly issue a new update (iOS 9.3.3?) as an emergency fix.

{"pred": "Phil and Jeanie -- basketball's ultimate power couple -- call it quits The engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014. Jackson and Buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. According to sources, that included a provision that the NBA and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry. There was such a distance in the way he said, \"The Lakers.\" This, after all, is the man who won five NBA titles in Los Angeles and was still engaged to Lakers president Jeanie Buss. But that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and Jackson spent more and more time in New York, running the Knicks, and in Montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason. Then there were hurdles, such as Jeanie Buss being the team's vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother Jim Buss being in charge of basketball operations. It was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years. The way they'd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other. That was Camelot. The owner's daughter dating the team's coach? And not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. And not just any coach: only the most successful NBA coach of all time. During the best of times, when the Lakers were winning NBA championships, they'd ride to the arena together from their house in Marina Del Rey. At games, Jeanie would sit with her girlfriends Linda Rambis and Stacy Kennedy in the second row, across the court from the Lakers bench, where Phil could see her and the players could hear her. As the years went by, Jackson focused in on the Knicks and Buss focused on the Lakers. He would come to Los Angeles when he could, and she would see him in New York when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect. The announcement -- via their personal Twitter accounts -- brought an end to the NBA's version of Camelot. Buss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the team's new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the league's new collective bargaining agreement. She also has maintained close ties with first-year coach Luke Walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous Lakers coaches. Those close to Buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the team's front office. His connection with Los Angeles, and his fiance\u0301e, was simply too hard to maintain. On Tuesday night, Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement. So now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together. If they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships. It did not break apart their relationship though. If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying. Both of their legacies are tied to what they do next. Buss must decide whether to reboot the Lakers' front office. Jackson needs to make the Knicks into a contender. Those close to Jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the Knicks, despite the mutual option that's built into his contract this summer. Phil Jackson wasn't in the mood to stop and catch up. His New York Knicks had gotten out of Staples Center with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers and he'd gone an entire game without having to wave to nostalgic Lakers fans on the big screen. \"I think the Lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff,\" Jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the Knicks' locker room on Dec. 11. There had been speculation that Jackson could return to the Lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from New York. Those are the types of implausible things that happen in Camelot. But when Dr. Buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash -- for what appeared to be Dr. Buss' last ride, Jackson raised his hand. This time, the Lakers didn't call on him. Or rather, general manager Mitch Kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the Lakers had chosen to hire Mike D'Antoni instead. So the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end Tuesday night. Camelot was over. Jackson was livid. His agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for L.A. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture. Once on the drive in, Jackson mentioned Lamar Odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man. So during the game, Buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for Odom as he checked into the game. \"Take your pants off!\" they yelled out, as Odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers' table. He beamed at the attention. Once Jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing. At first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. He had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. And his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court. All of those are massive things, that Jackson and Buss simply couldn't talk about given their current roles. So many tangled webs, and yet Jeanie Buss and Jackson somehow made it work for 17 years. As always, he would do it for Jeanie. Like the Camelot in Richard Burton's Broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance. It was never meant to be."}

{"pred": "That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media. He was referring to Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw. Wait, what? RT @lheron: Rebekah Brooks to return to News Corp to run...@Storyful? Did not see that coming: http://t.co/qMob2mSxcd \u2014 Mathew Ingram (@mathewi) March 2, 2015 But it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him. \"James Murdoch acquired MySpace and it didn't improve. One has to fear for Storyful in that Rebekah Brooks, for all her many talents as a tabloid journalist and editor, has really shown no mastery of social media,\" Jukes said. Brooks comes off to some as an odd fit for the role. As an editor for tabloid newspapers, she has had little experience with digital media or technology. Hide yo kids, hide yo wife MT @THR: Rebekah Brooks to Run News Corp's Storyful http://t.co/BZ69BFc5op pic.twitter.com/jc40DC07Qz \u2014 Liam Stack (@liamstack) March 1, 2015 Even if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful. But reports on Sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world. Brooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch's tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun. In June 2009, she took the role of chief executive as News International, a subsidiary of News Corp that operates numerous papers including The Sun and News of the World. Brooks' role at News Corp and Storyful in particular is still in some doubt. Reports from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal say that her position will include work on digital and social media initiatives broadly, with Storyful being one part of that puzzle. Having risen to the top of Britain's media elite, Brooks maintained friendships with many of the country's most influential figures, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, current Prime Minister David Cameron and Cameron's communications director Andy Coulson, who also edited News of the World and served jail time in the coming scandal. Brooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from The Guardian that her actions began to catch up with her. While Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp. Brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32. Peter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges. Brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media. The startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.) Jukes noted similarities between Brooks's new position and News Corp's acquisition of MySpace for $580 million. The company later sold the social network for $35 million. Those were the words of Rupert Murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of News of the World in a phone hacking scandal. Known as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana. \"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'Why was Rebekah put on trial,' but 'Why was she found not guilty?'\" Jukes said. By January 2011, London law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while Brooks led News of the World. Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive. News Corp declined to respond to inquires about Brooks and Storyful. Now, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow. The inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges. Storyful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners. News Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company. I feel so sorry for the people I know at @Storyful if this is true. http://t.co/eUpjZu5hVw They deserve better. \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) March 2, 2015 Another time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper \u2014 The Sunday Times \u2014 and then stole one of the paper's scoops.

{"pred": "Despite the fact that renowned author and illustrator Edward Gorey was born in Chicago and spent a sizable chunk of his formative years in the Windy City, his work has never been recognized with its own exhibition. That is, until now. The second exhibition, \"G is for Gorey, C is for Chicago,\" pulls from the collection of Loyola alumnus Thomas Michalak, a member of the board of directors of the Edward Gorey House in Massachusetts who has collected Gorey material for over two decades. It includes a number of rare items offering a deeper look at the mysterious man behind the art, including some of his report cards, early drawings and book covers he designed, and the ornately decorated envelopes of letters he sent to his mother, Helen. Edward Gorey Returns To Hometown With New Chicago Exhibition One of the shows, \"Elegant Enigmas: The Art of Edward Gorey,\" is a touring exhibition organized by the Brandywine Museum in Chadds Ford, Penn. that offers a comprehensive look at his illustrations as well as work by other artists he influenced. Pam Ambrose, director of LUMA, told HuffPost the shows aim to address the lack of awareness of Gorey's Chicago roots in addition to tracing the man's development from a budding artist to an acclaimed cultural icon who inspired creators like Daniel Handler and Tim Burton. His influence is also felt in \"Summerland: A Ghost Story,\" a small mixed-media installation by Chicago artist Kenneth Gerleve that's also also included in the show. Beginning earlier this month and continuing through June 15, the macabre creations of the late Gorey are front and center for two concurrent exhibitions at the Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) in Chicago. While Gorey will forever be linked to gothic subculture thanks in large part to his signature Victorian characters dressed in head-to-toe black, the show paints a broader portrait of the artist than that. For example, prominently-placed illustrations of cats throughout the show acknowledge his fascination with felines, and many of his kid-centric illustrations feel downright giddy when compared to his familiar somber style. \"This is an artist who was much more important than the immediate perception of just the gothic tale or cautionary tale,\" Ambrose said. The LUMA shows have been a hit -- they had people lined up outside the front door on opening day, \"pretty good\" for a university museum, Ambrose noted. Tickets to a Saturday bash celebrating what would have been Gorey's 89th birthday sold quickly. \"I want people to really think about who this man was,\" Ambrose said,\" because he appears to be many contradictions in one persona. But was this a persona invented to keep people away? It's very hard to say. He seems like someone who shapeshifts a bit.\""}

{"pred": "The oven cleaning hacks that will have your appliance sparkling in MINUTES without ANY scrubbing (from removing grease with oil to banishing bad smells with water) But now a new series of kitchen hacks reveals how you can get your appliance sparkling in no time at all - by using just a few simple products you probably already have in your home. 'A nifty cleaning cheat for treating stubborn stains is to use a homemade oven cleaner,' advises Rik Hellewell, founder and MD at oven valeting service Ovenu, who put together the tips. Scrubbing the oven is one of the most dreaded spring cleaning jobs. 'A glass scraper is ideal for removing tough stains from the door and floor of your oven. 'Take a dishwasher tablet and dip half of it in warm water. Next rub the tablet over the built-up grease on your oven door and watch the burnt-on dirt wash away with minimal effort.' 'This helps save you time and money. A simple mixture of white vinegar and baking soda works wonders to help remove grease and grime. 'If any dirt remains, don\u2019t worry. To get a ceramic hob clean, sprinkle with baking soda and a few drops of water. Then wipe clean with a soft cloth. If your oven has steel burners then place them in a resealable bag overnight with a drop of bleach and warm water. The next day, wipe the burners down and wash in warm, soapy water.' 'After the product has worked its magic, you should be able to simply wipe the grime away. If any burnt-on food remains, cover with your homemade cleaning solution of white vinegar and baking soda.'  'It may sound strange, but you can remove greasy build-up on the hood of your oven with oil. 'Cream of tartar may seem like an odd cleaning product to use on your oven, but it is extremely effective at keeping stainless steel shiny. 'Probably not that recently. However, in order to cook your food in a hygienic environment, you need to ensure that you keep them sparkling clean. 'Make sure that your oven is completely cool and then spray oven cleaner into the corners. Leave overnight if you can; if not, leave for at least four hours. 'Even better, if you use an electric toothbrush, the vibration will help to loosen any burnt-on food. 'An old toothbrush is an essential oven-cleaning tool. Its soft bristles and flexible head allow you to clean areas that would otherwise be out of reach. 'The oil helps to remove the grease without the use of any harsh chemicals. Once clean, spray the areas with all-purpose oven cleaner to ensure that no oil remains.' 'Dishwasher tablets are excellent at removing stuck-on food from your pots and pans in a dishwasher, so why should your oven be any different? 'A dirty hob is a sure sign of a dirty oven. A thin layer of car wax on your hob can help remove built-up grease. Simply apply and wipe away. 'The vinegar will react with the baking soda to foam gently. 'A quick way to restore your shelves to their former glory is to place the shelves in a resealable plastic bag, spray with oven cleaner, seal the bag, then leave to soak. Make sure you read the instructions on the cleaning product and wear protective clothing where necessary. 'If the door is removable, unscrew it and soak in oven cleaner and warm water, then scrape the stuck-on food residue away.' 1. CREATE YOUR OWN CLEANER 'Simply add a few drops in an ovenproof bowl filled with water. Slowly heat the bowl for an hour and you\u2019ll soon rid your kitchen of those pongs. 'After 30 minutes, remove the shelving from the resealable bag. Rinse them under warm water and use a scourer to scrub away any remaining burnt-on food.' 'Simply apply with a thin cloth, leave for 10 minutes, then wipe away.' 'In fact, this technique will make clean-ups in the future really easy. Place a couple of drops of vegetable oil onto a paper towel and rub it over the greasy area. 'When was the last time you removed the shelves from your oven?' asks Rik. 'There\u2019s a very quick and easy way to battle grease and grime. 4. USE A GLASS SCRAPER 9.

{"pred": "Lawmakers could do this to fight corruption. But they won\u2019t. - The Wa... Jolly speaks the truth. Lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system \u2014 but nothing happens. This is why Jolly\u2019s idea deserves a look. He calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform. The goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking. \"We\u2019re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money,\" he said. \"In the face of growing crises around the globe, you\u2019ve got a part-time Congress.\" This, he said, \"is a first-rate scandal.\" I\u2019ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working \u2014 returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees. Jolly, now a Senate candidate in Florida, offers another tack. Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the Orlando Sentinel calling Jolly\u2019s bill a \"cynical example of fraudulent reform\" because \"all that would change is that congressmen wouldn\u2019t have to do the dirty work.\" Democrats talk about overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics. But that ultimate fix isn\u2019t happening soon. In the House, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections \u2014 another good idea \u2014 but so far he has only one Republican, gadfly Walter Jones (N.C.). Republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once championed. But while Jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his Senate run. And though the bill wouldn\u2019t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways. And now? The number of co-sponsors on Jolly\u2019s bill has jumped from six all the way up to \u2014 um, eight. No senator has come forward with similar legislation. Jolly is a potential ally of Democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that Citizens United \"could be revisited\" and that \"we can do better.\" Until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause. \"You think you get elected to represent 700,000 people,\" he said. \"But you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you\u2019ve got to go raise $2 million \u2014 and that makes members angry.\" Then, three weeks ago, \"60 Minutes\" did a sympathetic piece on Jolly\u2019s idea, giving national attention to the scandal of lawmakers spending 30 or more hours a week dialing for dollars. \"If you\u2019ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there\u2019s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we\u2019re seeing the results of that,\" he said. \"We\u2019re looking at the last couple of sessions of the Congress of the United States as being the most unproductive in the history of the country. Why? Well, if everybody\u2019s busy campaigning and raising money, there\u2019s no time for governing.\" The Republican Party is predictably opposed. The National Republican Congressional Committee, in a letter to CBS after the \"60 Minutes\" segment, accused Jolly of peddling \"fiction\" when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day. In February, when Rep. David Jolly introduced his quixotic plan to ban members of Congress from soliciting campaign contributions, the Florida Republican had only six co-sponsors. But Jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman C.W. Bill Young, continues to agitate. He said he\u2019s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the NRCC, and he said \"I don\u2019t buy the notion\" that he needs more sponsors before House leadership grants a hearing on his bill. Or at least it should. Jolly, appearing Monday morning at the National Press Club with his lead Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Rick Nolan (Minn.), was not surprised. \"We\u2019ve got six more co-sponsors than I thought we might have,\" he said. It\u2019s \"a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the Congress are. . . . A member\u2019s political survival depends on raising money \u2014 that\u2019s the reality.\" Jolly\u2019s Democratic sidekick, Nolan, said that when he first served in Congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground. The little support Jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from Florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including Democrat Alan Grayson, also a Senate candidate. A Democratic congressional candidate in Florida, businessman Randy Perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop \"soliciting or accepting\" financial contributions."}
{"pred": "It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds. Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg. Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC. However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn\u2019t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online. Jeff Longo was wandering in the intense Florida heat when he saw a tiny ball of fluff on the sidewalk. What\u2019s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health. The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother\u2019s shoes. So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him \u2013 even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream. Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends \u2013 in the shape of Longo\u2019s dogs. That said, given their difference in stature, Longo admitted that he had to \"watch them so they don\u2019t accidentally squish her.\" This took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn\u2019t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll. First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website\u2019s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he\u2019d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for. As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family."}

{"pred": "I was really bad at sports in high school. This study helps me understand why. Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests \"deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,\" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either. Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors \u2014 some of which are genetic or biological in nature \u2014 that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include: A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much. But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. \"Essentially, learning rates vary,\" Macnamara says. \"Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.\" Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me. \"We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] \u2014 different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,\" she says. \"All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.\" Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty. I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive. For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a \"slow learner\" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best. More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other. Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find \"my sport\" \u2014 the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team. By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher \u2014 the varsity coach \u2014 pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades). The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities. Yet I'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team \u2014 a miracle. Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular \"10,000 hour rule,\" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up. \"One important thing \u2014 that's easy to misunderstand\u2014 is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,\" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. \"So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one\u2019s performance.\" For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation. But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100. Enjoyment of competition Differences in how we acquire muscle mass These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at. \"Eighteen percent is big,\" Macnamara says. \"We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything.\" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid. Personality and perseverance Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake Propensity to get injured Coordination On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try. Height So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent? Propensity to choke under pressure I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine. \"There\u2019s probably not one huge contributor that\u2019s accounting for everything else,\" she says."}

{"pred": "True Detective Season Two: How Big Is Justin Bieber's Penis? Two people claim to have personal connections with Justin Bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on Justin Bieber's payroll. While we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that Justin Bieber's penis is perfectly average\u2014large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement. That is evidence supporting the theory that Justin Bieber is adequately endowed. Arguing in favor of Justin Bieber's alleged big dick are two people: Tati Neves, a Brazilian model, and Bieber's trainer Patrick Nilsson. These two claim to have seen Bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, Calvin Klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong. A single question now plagues the minds of all Americans, weighing down our brains as we slump in our office chairs, then slump in our cars, then slump in our couches, and then slump into bed: how big is Justin Bieber's penis really? The swaggy lil pop star and his cavalry of minders would have us believe that Justin Bieber has a huge dick. There are a number of things we can glean from this photo. One is that Justin Bieber has muscles. Look at the strong boy! Another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-Photoshop version of the Calvin Klein shot in which a model gropes him. But because Bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is. This is perhaps the most revealing shot of Bieber's bulge in the wild. Does it look exceedingly large? I'd say not. In fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. Of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. However we can only work with the materials we have. Next we will consult a Tumblr called Justin Bieber's Bulge, a blog \"dedicated to Justin Bieber's glorious, wonderful bulge,\" which is not run by me. For a Tumblr devoted to one man's dick, it's a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo. Here is a fan shot of Justin Bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. We can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like Justin Bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as Calvin Klein might want us to believe. In this case, it appears, Justin Bieber is the same as any man. This is a screencap taken from a video of the Calvin Klein shoot that Bieber himself posted to Instagram. Here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. Front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of Calvin Klein's idealized Burmese python. Still, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: Have you ever had sex with Justin Bieber? Have you ever seen his dick? Do you know someone who has? Are you Scooter Braun? Let's settle this debate once and for all. Email me at jordan@gawker.com or leave a comment below. And to make up it, here's a new quote from Justin's trainer Patrick Nilsson, who says JB is packing. \"I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\" But in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential American question: What exactly is Bieber packing? (It's easy to make a case that Breathe Heavy's photos are the real deal: We know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as Bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier TMZ story alleging that Calvin Klein sculpted Bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in America gets touched up at some point. Why would Bieber's dick be a grand outlier?) Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him. Last week, Calvin Klein released photos of Bieber modeling their underwear for a new ad campaign. One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side: Neves claims to have slept with Bieber during his infamous Brazilian sex romp. Here is what she told a British tabloid about Bieber's D: In 2013, Bieber went to Hawaii and jumped off a cliff. After exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here: Last September, Bieber appeared onstage at the Fashion Rocks concert. For some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one. The question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake? Bieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint. Speaking to The Sun, Brazilian model Tati Nevas said: \"Take it from me, he's well endowed - and very good in bed.\" Nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the Calvin Klein Photoshop controversy. Here, according to Breathe Heavy, is his assessment: Let's be true detectives. Or did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation? Indeed you do. For that, we must consult more candid shots."}

It could have been \"I love you, but you\u2019re driving me crazy\" or any of the following: \"I love you, but you\u2019re not listening to me\"; \"I love you, but stop leaving dirty dishes in the sink\"; or \"I love you, but I need some alone time.\" I\u2019ve begun many a sentence with those four words, and never paused for a moment to think about what they mean. What are we actually conveying when we begin a sentence like that? My husband asked if I could replace the word \"but\" with the word \"and.\" I stopped and repeated the sentence I had just said to him with the revision, and the light bulb inside my head nearly blinded me with epiphany. \"I love you AND you are driving me crazy.\" I don\u2019t remember the exact day, or the exact reason, or even the exact words, but I know it started with \"I love you, but ...\" Suddenly, his driving me crazy was no longer an exception to my loving him. It was part and parcel of the package. I could love him and be driven crazy by him simultaneously! A little conjunction transduction made all the difference. What my husband heard wasn\u2019t the first part of the sentence, but the second, every time. What he heard was \"I love you if ...\" and \"I would love you, if only you would ...\" He didn\u2019t like it, he said so, and I\u2019m glad he did. It took me a while to make the change in my delivery permanent, but it was worth the effort. It has made a significant difference in my communication with my husband, and now, my kids. Above all else, I want my family to know that I love them regardless of circumstances, even if they are driving me crazy."}

{"pred": "For now, though, the three legends are the only ones left standing from the Class of 1998 -- unless you count the No. 23 overall pick, Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue. The '98 greats separately sat down with ESPN recently for a three-way Q&A. The rest of the top 10 -- No. 2 Mike Bibby, No. 3 Raef LaFrentz, No. 4 Antawn Jamison, No. 7 Jason Williams and No. 8 Larry Hughes -- all enjoyed some success but combined for a grand total of two All-Star appearances between them. The active trio has long stood head and shoulders above the rest of the class. The twilight tales of Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce I remember I didn't know who Jason Williams was, and he got drafted ahead of me. It was just weird. I thought I'd be in the top five, and I slipped all the way to 10, so it was a strange night for me. As of Thursday morning, Vince Carter is the lone member of the NBA's active 40-and-older club. At least a couple of his draft classmates are still around to help Carter celebrate his birthday. Nowitzki (29,757), Pierce (26,361) and Carter (24,295) have combined for 80,413 career points and have an outside shot to be the highest-scoring draft trio in NBA history. They rank behind only the Class of '84 (Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley with 82,995 points) and Class of '96 (Kobe Bryant, Ray Allen and Allen Iverson with 82,516). Nowitzki: I was always the young guy, the German wunderkind, the young guy coming up with talent. It felt like the next thing you know, I was 30. Those years just flew by. You're having fun, you're competing every year, and then in the summer, it's not like I was just sitting on my butt in my 20s. I played national team every year, so literally I took like two weeks off and then was right back in the gym working with Holger. If you stay busy, time flies. So my 20s, I felt like they were over in a heartbeat. Paul Pierce, 39, knows this season will be his last. Dirk Nowitzki, 38, hopes his body will let him play at least one more. Carter's feelings about his basketball future fluctuate, but the old man pulled off a half-amazing 360 layup in traffic on the last night of his thirties against the Raptors that raised him. Pierce, the No. 10 pick, will one day see his No. 34 raised to the rafters in Boston alongside the other Celtics greats, presumably pretty soon. \"The Truth\" has played for three teams in four seasons since leaving Boston, reuniting with coach Doc Rivers for his final stop with the Clippers, for whom Pierce is a part-time player but full-time locker room presence. Players like that are transcendent. He was a transcendent player. Pierce: I remember slipping and not really knowing where I was going to end up. Because I only worked out for the top five teams. Now, I'm prepared to move on to Phase 2. But it's kind of like, you do all the preparation to be prepared, but you're not prepared, if that makes sense. I remember seeing all of the other guys [with the Raptors], seeing Oak [Charles Oakley] and Antonio [Davis] and Kevin Willis and [Hakeem] Olajuwon, watching them in their final years. Then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like, 'Where do I go from here?' I mean, those guys were prepared. \"'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible.\" Carter: You finally get to the draft after working out for five or six teams, and it's the unexpected. We knew either Bibby or Olowokandi was going one or two, and then after that, it's all hearsay. I heard anywhere from three to eight. That's what I hear, so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call: 'OK, we're going to get you if you're available.' Nowitzki, the No. 9 pick despite not being sure of his desire to play in the NBA at the time, forced folks to change the way they think about 7-footers while he climbed to sixth on the league's all-time scoring list. He remains the face of the franchise in Dallas, the only NBA city he'll ever call home. Nowitzki: Vince just had unbelievable athleticism. I mean, he did stuff that I don't think we've seen before in this league. I was in Oakland at his dunk contest in [2000], and nobody's ever seen the stuff that he did. Dirk Nowitzki, on his reaction to being drafted by the Mavs in 1998 Other than that, I'm ready to go when the time is [right]. There's some mornings I wake up and it's like, 'Is it one more year? Or is it this year? Or is it three years?' I can never decide on a number. Scary. It really is for me, because I love this game, and I don't want to leave it. Not yet. A sore right Achilles tendon robbed Nowitzki of most of the first two months of this season, and most likely a chance to play in the postseason for the 16th time in 17 years, although the big German refuses to give up hope. \"I was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. I was on the West Coast back to the East Coast in a matter of five minutes.\" The forgettable career of the first overall pick, Los Angeles Clippers center Michael Olowokandi, has been over for a decade. Robert \"Tractor\" Traylor was selected by the Dallas Mavericks at No. 6 and swapped for a floppy-haired German kid a few picks later in a deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. After being out of the league for six years, Traylor died of a heart attack in 2011 while playing in Puerto Rico. But what kept him so long in the league now was really his skill level, even though obviously he still has some athleticism, still has some hops. But it's his shot, the repertoire of fadeaways that he's got, his 3-ball was always money and he's a big guy for a 2 or 3 that was always good on the block. He'd run a pick-and-roll going to his right, where he was always deadly. Then [Mavericks GM Donnie Nelson] and Nellie came maybe a couple of days later. They showed up in Wurzburg. [Then-Mavericks owner] Ross Perot came in the private plane. I had this press conference in this small little hotel that I'll never forget. It was unbelievable. I remember like maybe two or three media people showed up, because it was on such short notice, right? Ross was the one who wanted the press conference, but we couldn't even get a TV station there. There was literally like three people there. It was so bizarre, so bizarre. Nowitzki: [Heavy sigh.] That sounds like a lot. But you know, hopefully I can [stay] out there and I can score a few. Vince has been on a tear for a while, and Paul I don't think is playing much, but you know we're going to try. All three of us are competitors. I think as you get older, it's more important to be on a winning team. I'm sure Vince is enjoying that [the Grizzlies] are playing well, and Paul is enjoying the Clippers. We need some work. Pierce: He had unique ability, something you hardly see: great athleticism and great shooting touch. Usually you see one without the other. He had the combination of both. That's rare. It's something this league has not seen in a long time. I know this is the last year, so I'm enjoying it as much as I can. Carter: First of all, his work ethic. He puts a lot of time in, and it's different than any other player I've ever seen. I've been around long enough to see a lot of guys train and prepare, but he just loves the game. He loves to play. He loves to compete. And he's selfless. He's all about the good of the team. Nowitzki: He was strong. He'd get to his spots. He was a clutch shooter. He definitely had the clutch gene. Great pump fake, could get to the foul line. I mean, he was the complete package from the small forward standpoint. You put a smaller guy on him, he was able to post and shoot over him. Could drive both ways, even ran some pick-and-rolls. Pierce: Dirk changed the game, man. When you look at what he was able to bring with his versatility and his shooting as a 7-footer, to be able to put the ball on the ground, he was one of the first stretch 4s that you see more of today. I mean, he revolutionized the game. I've had many, many, many great battles against him and know him very well. Of course, we all know Paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3-point line. He's just another professional scorer. Carter: He was a killer. He's been like that since high school. I remember us playing against each other in the McDonald's [All-American Game] and just being around each other. He's always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted. In the locker room, on the court, I'm just soaking it all in. I've been around this game for a long time -- a lot of plane rides, a lot of bus rides, a lot of pregame speeches, a lot of national anthems. I'm enjoying the ride, man. That's when I met Nashie [Steve Nash] for the first time, because they flew him in for the press conference. It kind of clicked from there. I think on my second night, Nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me, and Fin [Michael Finley] came and Strick [Erick Strickland] came. Nashie was there and some of the other guys who were in town. I just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak as much as I could with my English. Nowitzki: I didn't go to the draft. I actually worked out with Holger [Geschwindner, Nowitzki's shooting coach] those couple of days, and I stayed at Holger's house. We couldn't watch it anywhere. It wasn't on TV back in Germany. I remember in the middle of the night, we got a call and it was [then-Mavericks coach] Don Nelson. He was like, 'Hey, we just drafted you guys. We'd love to come over and see you guys,' because I had said that I wasn't sure if I was coming [to the NBA] or not. I was like, 'This is crazy!' After the whole Hoop Summit, I guess there was a little hype, but I never thought somebody would take a chance on me that high, especially after saying that I wasn't sure if I would come or not, worried about basically going from the second division to the NBA. That was a huge jump, and I was a little worried. It was bizarre. 'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible. I was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. I was on the West Coast back to the East Coast in a matter of five minutes. Mind you, everybody [at their tables] had their hat fixed perfectly. Basically, here's your hat to that table, here's your hat to this table. It was a pretty cool thing. Not only did [Jamison and I] get to experience the draft beside each other, but we got traded for each other as well, so it was pretty cool. I just remember sitting around. Olowokandi, OK. Bibby, OK. Raef LaFrentz, great. From there, you really didn't know. I remember sitting at the table next to me was Antawn Jamison. Our families were sitting next to each other, laughing and talking. I remember saying, 'Man, what do you think is going to happen?' We had no idea. Carter, the No. 5 pick -- who was traded for Jamison, his friend and North Carolina teammate, on draft night -- soared to eight All-Star appearances with the Toronto Raptors and New Jersey Nets. Once known as \"Half Man, Half Amazing,\" Carter redefined his game as he aged, becoming a sage role player in recent years, now helping the Memphis Grizzlies fight for playoff positioning in the Western Conference. Vince Carter, on being traded from Golden State to Toronto on draft night And then I go to Boston, a team I really didn't like growing up, because I was a Lakers fan. But you know, things happen for a reason. I guess it was meant for me to be in Boston. It worked out OK. He had the big body and he knew how to use it. There are some people who are big and strong, but they don't use it like that. Paul used it. And he was deceptively quick, so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you, you just hope he missed. Next thing you know, you're 30 and you're sort of like a mid-aged guy. Couple of young guys, but still a couple older guys. Then the last few years, you're just the oldest guy. It's amazing how 19 years just have flown by. But if you stay busy, if you have a blast ... They called Antawn at four. I mean, he was my suitemate in college and very good friends, so [I was] over the moon. It felt like I got drafted, because I was just nervous and excited for him, as if it was me. But the weird thing about it at the time was that he never worked out for Toronto. So it was kind of like, 'OK, well, they just really wanted him.' I worked out for them, and Toronto told me basically, 'If you're available, we're going to go get you, so you might as well come work out.' That's what we were hearing, so I took my workout and everything. And when it mattered, he made big shots. I wouldn't say he was a great flat-out 3-point shooter, but when the game was on the line, you never really wanted him shooting the 3. He was a competitor and really just a great all-around player. He's a professional scorer. I say this about myself, too, and you could probably say it about Paul as well: When you see him walk into the arena before a game, you could probably say there's no way in hell that those guys are playing tonight. Then Dirk will come in and drop 35. Regardless of how he feels before the game, once the big lights are on and you come on the court, he knows how to get it done, plain and simple. Pierce: Oh, it's fun. I'm enjoying every moment. Shootaround, I'm enjoying. The bus rides, the plane rides with the guys, I'm enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that I'm going to get with my team. Now, I'm still trying to compete. I enjoy doing it. Obviously, it's not as easy as back in the day. All the extra work you have to put in to stay ready. Now dealing with injuries that I really never had, it takes the fun away a little bit, but hopefully I can [stay healthy] and have fun. Then Ross flew out again, and Donnie and Nellie stayed for a few days and talked to me over and over. They said, 'Hey, don't make a decision before we fly you to Dallas. We want you to see everything and meet some of the guys.' So I agreed to that. I flew back with Donnie and Holger, stayed at Nellie's house back in the day. Had a press conference. Never had a suit, so I remember right from the airport, we went right to Lombardo's [Custom Apparel in Dallas]. I had the worst jacket on, and we had a press conference. It's something I never really thought about until -- I'm going to say five years ago: just making sure I'm ready. Because you hear the stories about guys who step out into the world when they retire, and it's like, 'All right, I have some money in my pocket. Where do I go?' Then just spending and spending, and you hear the next horror story that they go broke. That's something that I vow never to do. Carter: It's possible. It's possible. I mean, God willing with health, of course, and opportunity. I think it's possible if we stay healthy. Dirk wants to play another year, and with his ability to score, he's going to get touches. I'm putting all of the pressure on him. I remember getting my hat from [\"hat lady\"] Chrysa Chin, and then I'm walking up the steps and as I'm walking, I see Antawn at the bottom of the steps still. I was like, 'Hey, what's up?' As soon as I took the picture, David Stern says to me, 'Wait right here, there's about to be a trade. We'll go from there.' Nellie said, 'At the end of the day, if things don't work out, you could always go back to Europe.' That's always an option after two or three years [when] your contract is over. If they don't take the option after three years, you're back home in Europe. So the next day, I went to the press conference and was like, 'I'll try.' I mean, he was a tough matchup because he could post, and he was so freakishly athletic. He'd come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot. Obviously, he's so athletic that once he got going to the rim, you could challenge him, but he was going to put you on a poster. He was fun to watch during his prime. Carter: I'm a little uneasy sometimes. Some days, I'm OK with it. I know it's near, and I'm preparing myself for it. But some days, I'm like, 'Man, I'm not ready to walk away from it,' because I still enjoy being in the gym. I still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking. There's nothing better when you've done this so long. It's all you know. Maybe not all I know, but all I've done and all I've enjoyed doing at this point. That's one thing, having the opportunity to play with a go-to guy, a superstar like himself, is that he's willing to make the right play. It's not always like, 'The play is for me; I have to make the shot.' 'The play is for me; I have to make the right play,' that's his mentality. But when he wants the ball, he's going to say, 'Give me the ball.' Then the next night was our decision. They set a press conference the morning before I left, and Nellie was like, 'Think about it all night, but we need a decision before you leave.' So that night was rough. I remember I was sitting with Holger around the pool for hours. Obviously, I had concerns. I had concerns about making that huge jump. I'd never lived anywhere but with my parents. I guess the end of the story was, 'We'll try.' They had a young team. It wasn't like they were a great team right [then], not really a playoff team, so you could get some minutes and develop. Pierce: It's going to be tough. It's not looking good. I'm not playing much. Our only chance is Vince Carter now. Dirk has been hurt. But who knows? Man, we've got a shot. We've got a shot. But I think LeBron [James], [Dwyane] Wade and [Carmelo Anthony] are going to crush it. LeBron, Wade and Melo are coming. And they're coming fast. For me, an idle mind is just awful. I think I'd be a miserable person, and I'd get on a lot of people's nerves if I'm retired and I have nothing to do. I can't just sit around. People are like, 'Oh, you get to retire and go to all these countries and visit.' I can't do that. That's not who I am. I'm not a vacation guy like that. I wouldn't like it. I know that, so I'd have to find something to do. That's where Phase 2 started years ago as far as kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what I'm really passionate about. But then, they drafted him, so I was just perplexed a little bit, like, 'Wait a minute, what the heck's going on here?' But nevertheless, I was excited for him and like, 'Whatever.' You know, you're just living in the moment. OK, I step back. I'm holding my hat, looking at it. The first thing I said is, 'Dang, somebody's getting traded already on draft night.' Dang it, it was me, and it all came together. Well, Antawn I guess got the word that there was going to be a trade. That's why he was sitting there. I didn't know, because of course, by the time it was happening I was already walking up to the stage. It blindsides me, pretty much. But then it all made sense. Then I started looking around. When the camera starts getting close to you, you figure they're talking about you. 'This could be it.' You try to play it cool. Then I get the phone call like right before and they call your name, and it was just over the moon. The coaching thing is still up in the air. I get asked about it all the time. I enjoy it, but I don't know if I want to do it. It's just the weirdest thing. I guess it makes sense, but to me, it still doesn't make sense. How is it that you enjoy it, have been doing it all these years but can see yourself [coaching full time]? I really can't see myself as a coach as of right now. In the broadcasting world, I can see it clear as day. I'm still fighting with that."}

{"pred": "Cancer Is Contagious Among Clams. What About Us? He and his colleagues began to wonder if other species of clams or related animals \u2014 known collectively as bivalves \u2014 had contagious cancers of their own, and, if so, why. They chose to study cancers in mussels, cockles and golden carpet shell clams. For years, Tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known to contract contagious cancer. But last year, Stephen P. Goff, a molecular biologist at Columbia University, and his colleagues found contagious cancer in soft-shell clams. From New York to Prince Edward Island, these clams have suffered from aggressive tumors since the 1970s. Carol Reinisch, a marine biologist at Environment Canada, found that the cancer clustered in populations, as if it was caused by an outbreak of some sort. They concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clams and then jumped species, infecting golden carpet shell clams. It killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clams, leaving only resistant ones behind. \"Somehow, this cancer has been spreading from clam to clam up the coast,\" Dr. Goff said. With eight contagious cancers now on the books, Dr. Murchison has started to wonder if they are not as peculiar as previously thought. \"They might be emerging fairly often,\" she said. In every case, the researchers reported in the journal Nature, the cancers in the animals were contagious. \"We are now at four for four,\" Dr. Goff said. \"We were always thinking there would be more contagious cancer out there, but we didn\u2019t know where they would be discovered,\" said Elizabeth P. Murchison, a cancer biologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the new study. The evolution of a contagious cancer in some ways may mirror the evolution of a single tumor in the body. In shellfish, Dr. Murchison said, \"we can see the effect of evolution on their genomes in a more pronounced way.\" Instead, the scientists matched the cancer\u2019s DNA to pullet shell clams, which live in the same intertidal beds off the coast of Spain. But Dr. Goff and his colleagues could not locate any pullet shell clams with this disease. After examining the DNA, they confirmed that the cancer cells in different clams all came from a single common ancestor. As it turned out, the cancer in cockles comprises two separate strains. Even stranger, the cancer cells in the golden carpet shell clams did not develop from the species\u2019s own cells. Dr. Goff and his colleagues are now trying to turn the contagious cancer in shellfish into a model for human cancers. They hope to find clues to metastasis, the way cancer spreads through the body. \"That\u2019s really quite incredible,\" Dr. Murchison said, noting that scientists had tried without success to infect foxes and other dog relatives with canine cancer. The new study, she said, shows that contagious cancer can indeed cross the species barrier. The two researchers found no evidence of a virus in the soft-shell clams. But they did discover that DNA in the tumor cells carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cells in the clams. Yet it\u2019s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power. In 1965, scientists put mosquitoes in a cage with hamsters, one of which had cancer. The mosquito carried the cancer cells to the healthy hamsters. So should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer? \"I don\u2019t think we should be starting to panic,\" Dr. Murchison said. Dogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex. The tumor usually disappears in a few months, however. Scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago. However they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim. Either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started. There have been rare reports of people transmitting cancer. An estimated 0.04 percent of organ transplant recipients contract cancer from the donor organ, for example. But in these cases, the cancer does not spread like a true parasite from host to host. The new research \"does raise the possibility that these types of diseases could arise in humans,\" Dr. Murchison said. A decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions. In the 1990s Tasmanian devils in Australia began developing deadly face tumors. But DNA in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed. In the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell. These mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses. Tasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single Tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s. Transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other Tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious. A second strain of the cancer was identified last year. She suspected a cancer-causing virus moving from host to host. For help, Dr. Reinisch turned to Dr. Goff."}
{"pred": "Syria Conflict Indicates Armageddon, Say One Third Of Americans (SURVEY) Twenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that \"U.S. military intervention in Syria might lead to the Battle of Armageddon that\u2019s spoken about in the Book of Revelation.\" Ed Stetzer, president of LifeWay Research, was surprised by the results of the survey. He said that previous U.S. military actions like the war in Afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on Bosnia \"didn't get the same reaction.\" However, Syria's shared border with Israel, as well as the explicit Biblical mention of Damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses. Most things aren't really the end of the world, but one-third of Americans who were surveyed believe that the Syria conflict is an indication that our days are numbered. A biblical passage which prophesies the destruction of Damascus and links it to the coming of Armageddon is leading many people to think that the current violence is an apocalyptic omen. A LifeWay Research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, \"I believe the battles in Syria are all part of the prophecies of the Book of Revelation,\" and 32 percent of them said yes. Location and income also skewed the results, with Southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect Syria with the end of days. Stetzer said that he could see why attaching Biblical significance to the Syria conflict would appeal to many Christians, because, \"For Christians, the end of the world doesn\u2019t mean despair. The end is really a new beginning.\" Isaiah 17:1 is one of the passages most frequently referenced when relating Syria to the end of the world. It states: Gender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between Biblical prophecy and the current situation in Syria. In addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, \"I believe the world will end in my lifetime.\" The Rev. Mark Hitchcock of Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Okla., speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times \"want to know that God is in charge. They want to know that someone has his hands on the wheel,\" according to LifeWay. Though he believes the Bible does predict future events in the Middle East, the author of The End: A Complete Overview of Bible Prophecy and the End of Days said that he \"does not think the trouble in Syria was predicted in the Bible.\" The burden of Damascus.

The trial will last up to six months, after which, the dogs will continue to be monitored to hopefully determine an increase in life expectancy. Geneticist Daniel Promislow told The Telegraph: A longer trial is underway to determine how extended treatments with rapamycin affect the longevity in dogs. After the results that have been seen in the mice study, the researchers believe that they could see a dog\u2019s life extended by up to five years by making them more impervious to health issues such as cancer, kidney failure, and dementia. When examining the benefits of a drug that extends life expectancy, it\u2019s not enough to look at how many years are being added on, but the quality of the years being added. Researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Dog Aging Project are quick to point that out when they talk about their hopes for rapamycin. Not only would it increase the length of dogs\u2019 overall lives, but it would compound that by increasing their number of \"good\" years. Promislow remains optimistic on both fronts, saying, \"If we can understand how to improve the quality and length of life, it\u2019s good for our pets and good for us. It\u2019s win-win.\" \"If rapamycin has a similar effect in dogs \u2013 and it\u2019s important to keep in mind we don\u2019t know this yet \u2013 then a typical large dog could live two to three years longer, and a smaller dog might live four years longer.\" The drug, also known as sirolimus, was originally developed and prescribed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs in humans, and also to fight cancer. However, in low doses, rapamycin was shown to slow aging processes and increase the lifespan of mice."}
{"pred": "A second Catholic university in California this week has dropped elective abortion coverage for its staff. The move appears to be part of a trend among Catholic campuses seeking to uphold their religious beliefs while employing and enrolling many non-Catholics, the Los Angeles Times notes. Just this week, Loyola Marymount University, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year. \"Our core commitments as a Catholic university are incompatible with the inclusion of elective abortion coverage in the University's health plans,\" Engh wrote in the letter. Santa Clara University Drops Elective Abortion Coverage For Staff, In What May Be A Trend The change by the universities moves in the opposite direction of California's abortion law. Just this week, Gov. Jerry Brown, himself a former Jesuit seminarian, signed a bill allowing nurses and midwives to perform abortions. Health plans must cover birth control under the Affordable Care Act, but Obamacare allows employers to offer plans that restrict abortion coverage. \"An elective abortion is a serious moral evil, and if it\u2019s in our power to end that on whatever level we can operate, we should do our best to end that moral evil,\" Bretzke said to CBS. \"They believe that that is a moral evil and so they\u2019re pursuing dropping that from their packages.\" President Obama's Affordable Care Act requires that birth control be covered but allows employers to restrict abortion coverage. The move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made. In a letter dated Oct. 3, Santa Clara University President Michael Engh announced the 2014 change to the Jesuit university's 1,600 employees. Father Jim Bretzke, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, sympathized with Santa Clara's decision. \"The policy comes as quite a shock,\" Nancy Unger, a history professor at Santa Clara, said to NBC. \"There was no discussion.

{"pred": "College president: \u2018This is not a day care. This is a university!\u2019 This is not a day care. This is a university! This fall, protests at Yale, Princeton, Duke and the University of Missouri \u2014 where the chancellor and system president resigned in the midst of turmoil \u2014 drew national attention to the concerns many students have about how minorities are treated on campus. Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, weighed in with a letter to the campus community: If you\u2019re more interested in playing the \"hater\" card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don\u2019t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in Missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but Oklahoma Wesleyan isn\u2019t one of them. If you want the chaplain to tell you you\u2019re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you\u2019re looking for. If you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place. The protests have also prompted debate about freedom of speech and whether students should be protected from words and ideas that make them uncomfortable. This past week, I actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt \"victimized\" by a sermon on the topic of 1 Corinthians 13. It appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! In his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable. At OKWU, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered. We are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge. We want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict. We believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin. We don\u2019t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don\u2019t issue \"trigger warnings\" before altar calls. Oklahoma Wesleyan is not a \"safe place\", but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn\u2019t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that\u2019s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that\u2019s wrong with them. This is a place where you will quickly learn that you need to grow up! So here\u2019s my advice: I have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. That feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! An altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! It is supposed to make you feel guilty! The goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins \u2014 not coddle you in your selfishness. The primary objective of the Church and the Christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization! I\u2019m not making this up. Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them \"feel bad\" about themselves, is a \"hater,\" a \"bigot,\" an \"oppressor,\" and a \"victimizer.\""}

{"pred": "Mr. Colbert\u2019s promotion of \"California\" started with Sherman Alexie, an anti-Amazonian and National Book Award winner for \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.\" Mr. Colbert invited Mr. Alexie on his show and asked him to bring a book by an author penalized by Amazon\u2019s refusal to take Hachette preorders. Mr. Alexie said that he asked Hachette for a few advance copies of books by debut authors to peruse. Even before the boost from Mr. Colbert, \"California\" was receiving praise from respected novelists like Jennifer Egan and Ben Fountain and popping up on summer reading lists. Little, Brown ultimately printed 60,000 hardcovers. How Ms. Lepucki ended up as perhaps the only author to benefit from the Amazon-Hachette spat over pricing is a tale of almost unbelievable luck. And it has a twist: Her husband, Patrick Brown, is employed, in a sense, by Amazon. He works for Goodreads, a social network and peer recommendation engine for books; Amazon acquired it last year. Edan Lepucki\u2019s Novel \u2018California\u2019 Gets a Boost From Colbert \"Amazon has historically been a bully, and I don\u2019t shop there,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"But I love Goodreads. For the record. And my marriage.\" Oh, they care. \"California,\" which arrives on Tuesday, is now one of the most preordered debut titles in Hachette history, according to a company spokeswoman. Ms. Lepucki\u2019s agent is negotiating rights with the producer Gregg Fienberg and Killer Films. Little, Brown and Company, the Hachette division behind \"California,\" has increased the initial print order and doubled the length of her author tour. Ms. Lepucki found herself in Portland, Ore., this week to sign 10,000 copies of her novel for the independent superstore Powell\u2019s Books, where \"California\" hit No. 1 on the best-seller list after Mr. Colbert directed viewers there. \"California\" was on the top of the stack. \"I honestly suspected it wasn\u2019t going to be my kind of book \u2014 too earnest,\" Mr. Alexie said in a telephone interview. \"But I started reading it, and it turned out to be an earnest page turner.\" \"California\" is actually her second novel. But the first, a disturbing story about teenage girls that her agent, Erin Hosier, called \"the novel equivalent of a Harmony Korine movie,\" failed to sell to a publisher. \"It was overly ambitious,\" Ms. Hosier said. \"We finally stopped trying to sell it, because the rejection became too embarrassing and painful.\" That put more pressure on \"California.\" \"You really can\u2019t fail twice in a row if you have her credentials,\" Ms. Hosier said. \"I felt kind of icky to be benefiting from this fight,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"At the same time, the opportunity to reach readers is a fantasy.\" Ms. Lepucki is a graduate of Oberlin College and the University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, and is the founder and director of Writing Workshops Los Angeles, which has drawn 1,300 participants since it began in 2008. She is also known in book circles as a writer for The Millions, a highbrow literary website. But insta-fame feels more than a little weird, and she confessed to feeling awkward about the experience of being interviewed. She had another confession to make, too: Yes, she shuns Amazon, but just to be honest she did once buy a tin of Bag Balm, a salve first developed to soothe cow udders. \"I had a chapped elbow,\" she explained. But no. \"I\u2019m madly in love with my husband, but it\u2019s not us,\" she said. \"People seem to hate Frida, so I hope I\u2019m not her.\" (Her mother-in-law\u2019s response to the book: \"I\u2019m sad she killed me in a blizzard.\") Ms. Lepucki winced when asked if the couple in \"California\" is modeled on her and her husband. It\u2019s an easy guess to make, especially since she became pregnant with their 3-year-old son, Dixon Bean, while writing. \"Occasionally, my brain would overheat, and I\u2019d forget how to write,\" she said of her signing session. \"My signature is like a squished spider.\" With its post-apocalyptic setting, \"California\" mines a very busy vein in contemporary fiction. But Ms. Lepucki sees it as a love story. A young couple, Frida and Cal, have fled the ruins of Los Angeles to make a home in the wilderness. Everything changes when Frida becomes pregnant, and they leave isolation for a strange settlement filled with threats. \"I have a darker imagination than most people,\" she said. \"If you don\u2019t ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really human.\" It seems impossible that a story with such dark undercurrents could spring from someone so laid-back and gregarious. Over breakfast in Los Angeles, where she grew up, the freckled Ms. Lepucki displayed a surferish vibe, right down to the wet blond hair that she twisted to the side as she spoke. Still, her eyes, which are a striking shade of blue, had a tendency to flash mischievously. \"I did still wonder whether anyone would care,\" she added."}

So much so that he slept in a utility closet in college because it reduced his rent to only $100 a month. Meet the NFL player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money (1:31) Tim Masthay, of the Green Bay Packers, and his wife Amanda are the best team in the NFL when it comes to personal finance. When you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, Tim said. \"How do I spend it? How do I save it? How do I budget? How am I going to play? Because it\u2019s very difficult to project how much you\u2019re going to earn in an NFL career. It might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career.\" Also see: What it\u2019s like to take a finance class with a lot of NFL players The unique financial challenges of being an NFL player \u2014 and the wife of a player Tim and his wife Amanda recently attended the NFL\u2019s Personal Finance Camp, which educates players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing. How the NFL keeps its players from going broke (1:58) See what it's like to attend the NFL's Personal Finance Camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing. That made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. One way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. He said it was just big enough to fit a bed. Tim wasn\u2019t drafted out of college but was signed \u2014 and released \u2014 by the Indianapolis Colts before the 2009 season started. He later signed with the Green Bay Packers and has had great success with them. He signed a five-year, $6 million contract in 2012 that included a $1.2 million signing bonus. And he won a Super Bowl with the Packers in 2011. When we asked the Masthays what they did with his first big NFL paycheck, they said a big chunk went toward the league\u2019s 401(k) plan and another went into an education fund for their young children. Tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum. \"There was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn\u2019t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience.\" While Tim was trying to make an NFL roster, Amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. \"That was all the money we had. So we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. I almost fell on the floor when I saw it. I had never seen that much money in my life,\" Amanda said. Tim said that at Kentucky\u2019s business school he took a class in his sophomore year \u2014 in which he met Amanda, incidentally \u2014 and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you\u2019re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it\u2019s historically returned, you\u2019d have $1 million when you were 60. \"I remember thinking, wow that\u2019s interesting,\" he said. And when asked if he ever had to switch financial advisers like many athletes do because they\u2019re not happy with the advice or returns they\u2019re getting, Tim said he\u2019s never had one. He invests his money himself in low-cost index funds. \"By the time I graduated I had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. That\u2019s what I bought her wedding ring with,\" he said. (He spent part of it on the ring.) Tim, 29, met his wife Amanda while they were sophomores at the University of Kentucky. They married soon after graduating and have two children and a third on the way. They\u2019re clearly a great team, but what made them so smart about money? Here\u2019s what they shared with us. Amanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the Personal Finance Camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season. You would think one of the professors leading the classes at the camp said this, but Tim did, after being asked why he attended. Spouses of players were invited to the event, which was held between April 4 and April 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He said another challenge is that they\u2019re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. \"We receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you\u2019ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. It\u2019s a little different way of being paid than I think most people are,\" Tim said. Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Tim Masthay punting in a game against the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 14, 2014. During the interview, Amanda and Tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other\u2019s sentences. When we asked Tim what he thought helped him go from being waived by the Colts in 2009 to setting records with the Packers in 2011, Amanda said: \"He married me.\" I almost fell on the floor when I saw his first paycheck. Amanda Masthay What it\u2019s like to make so much money while you\u2019re in your 20s How they got so smart about money Marriage and money \"Personal finance acumen is important for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a high income or a low income earner or somewhere in between. If you\u2019re old or young or single or married. It\u2019s important for everyone.\" Tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate. They bought a house in Kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in Green Bay. They\u2019ve since sold the Kentucky home but say they didn\u2019t like owning a home they only used for part of the year. \"Finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there\u2019s something we can do that\u2019s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn\u2019t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives?\" They were tempted to buy things when they got the check. \"It took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn\u2019t buy some car that we really couldn\u2019t afford,\" she said. \"If we ever went on vacation as kids, I remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and I would do chores around the house and go wash people\u2019s cars and save up for my spending money,\" Amanda said. The Masthays said their educations at the University at Kentucky \u2014 he was an economics major and she was a marketing major \u2014 were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential. And if you\u2019re wondering how many credit cards they have. They have one.

Nonetheless, the Tennessee state House has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized Sex Week, which the House called \"an atrocious event.\" Last week, two other state senators -- Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Government Operations Committee Chairman Mike Bell (R-Riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward Sex Week. State lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the University of Tennessee (UT) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to \"engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events.\" Even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated. (The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.) Both of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics. Campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. The legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013. UT administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with Campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard. Another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker. \"If people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, I think that could have a significant impact,\" UT faculty senate president David Golden told the TV station WATE. \"I can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus.\" On Monday, a petition opposing Campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. In addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers Friday. Gov. Bill Haslam (R) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law. A UT-Knoxville graduate student provided The Huffington Post with a form email she received from Campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. The lawmaker said: While I support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. Sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized."}

{"pred": "So, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology? However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid \u2014 and this is a key part of science.\" For something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable.\" Plus, astrology doesn\u2019t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science. 1. Does astrology use testable ideas? There haven\u2019t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance. Yes, astrology\u2019s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality. So far, it can\u2019t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence \u2014 and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid. A hospital in Argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. The guidance is given based on the patient\u2019s sign \u2014 whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth \u2014 and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient. So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there\u2019s not much scientific evidence to back those claims. Until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience. Diego Andre\u0301s Golombek, a professor at the University of Quilmes in Argentina, told Quartz, \"Astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment.\" Unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity. \"And, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. I am horrified by this prospect!\" Looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint. There are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Understanding Science website lays out a \"Science checklist.\" SEE ALSO: 6 Questions to Ask Before Sharing Science on the Internet 3.

{"pred": "An unlikely company has suddenly catapulted to the top of the fashion world: Amazon. Amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the US, with its apparel sales totaling $16.3 billion last year, Bloomberg reports. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while the department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period. The company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York Men's Fashion Week. Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Department-store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and on consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated \u2014 not things for which Amazon is necessarily known. But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason that Amazon was investing in fashion: \"Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item,\" than with cheaper products, he said. Amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of the clothing website ShopBop. Three years later, Amazon bought the online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million. That's more than the combined online sales of Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Gap, and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands in the same period, according to Bloomberg. \"We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion,\" the analysts wrote in a recent note. But Amazon's strategy appears to be working. The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the past 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley. Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor Caroline Palmer."}
{"pred": "These Are The Shower Habits That You Need To Ditch Check out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good. Did you know theres actually a right way to shower? Get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo. Here are the things you need to stop doing while showering. However, did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy? Believe it or not, some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you\u2019ve never thought of. Showering is\u2014and should be\u2014a daily habit for most of us, and everyone has their own routine. Some people can\u2019t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two, and the differences continue on from there. If you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash, try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you\u2019re out of the shower. 6. Showering in Hard Water If you\u2019re unable to add a water softener to your shower, try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals. 7. Avoiding Cold Showers Most people wouldn\u2019t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second, let alone taking an entire shower in water that\u2019s anything less than steaming hot. In addition to speeding up your metabolism, a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time. Anyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit. Fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily, so it\u2019s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape. Plus, you won\u2019t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create \"questionable\" smells. Still, cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair, and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference. A quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function, increase your metabolism, and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate. You might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you\u2019re in the shower, so there\u2019s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash. You\u2019d be wrong, though. Be honest, how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower? Months? YEARS? As it turns out, that can be terrible for your health. This video demonstrates why: Without a doubt, it\u2019s easier and less messy to wash your face when you\u2019re already in the shower. However, despite the convenience, it\u2019s actually not good for your face. The water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you\u2019d wash with at the sink, and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly. Those with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation\u2014it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively. Use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower, particularly if you have acne-prone skin or rosacea. 9. Leaving Your Razor in the Shower 1. Washing Your Face If you don\u2019t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower, at least make sure that you hang it up when you\u2019re done using it so it can air dry. Yes, those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly-made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up, but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time. 3. Not Washing or Replacing Your Loofah Regularly There\u2019s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore\u2014imagine what you\u2019re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash. 2. Not Washing Your Feet 5. Using Scented Soaps Consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you\u2019re out, or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying. Some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard, but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage. 4. Using a Soap Dish Giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea, but doing so every day could actually be causing damage. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so. Even if you\u2019re not prone to smelly feet, think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day. Not only that, but if you\u2019re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes, you never know what you might be picking up along the way. 10. Over Exfoliating Yes, that built-in soap dish is there forever, but using it for its intended purpose actually isn\u2019t that good of an idea. The majority of people don\u2019t use bars of soap these days but, for those who do, be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it\u2014bacteria that you\u2019re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up. Anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells, which can make your skin red and irritated as a result. It\u2019s best to let some dead cells build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that, you know, there\u2019s actually something there worth exfoliating.' Remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria? The same thing goes for your razor. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide, and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm, wet environment. Hard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium, which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair. Those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands, or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker. For most of us, old razors aren\u2019t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis. Instead, they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one. Razors, whether you\u2019re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable, are surprisingly expensive\u2014so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work? Well, just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s doing so effectively. If you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave, it\u2019s because the blades are dull and it\u2019s time for a replacement. 8. Using Old Razors"}

The group, which won a Nobel Prize for the findings, dubbed it a \"slow virus.\" When researchers made their way to those villages in the 1950s, they found something disturbing. Among a tribe of about 11,000 people called the Fore, up to 200 people a year had been dying of an inexplicable illness. They called the disease kuru , which means \"shivering\" or \"trembling.\" The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic \u2014 the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , a degenerative neurological disorder similar to kuru. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in a million people in the U.S. develop CJDthe difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. Kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. Mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. But what about other prion diseases in other animals? Could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? That's what researchers in North America, including Belay, are trying to find out right now. In many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. It was an act of love and grief. Many locals were convinced it was the result of sorcery. The disease primarily hit adult women and children younger than 8 years old. In some villages, there were almost no young women left. But while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades. People have developed variant CJD after eating the meat of cattle infected with But while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades. People have developed variant CJD after eating the meat of cattle infected with mad cow disease . Dr. Ermias Belay, a prion disease researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is \"definitive evidence\" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species. \"Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission,\" says Belay. He says he and his colleagues have yet to find any evidence that hunters have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat of infected wild animals. But it wasn't a virus \u2014 or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. It was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive. Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called it the \"laughing death.\" Within a year, they couldn't get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions. As one medical researcher As one medical researcher described , \"If the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the Fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects.\" Women removed the brain, Women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. They fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. It was primarily adult women who did so, says Lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body. Belay says the disease is \"a little bit concerning\" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk. Lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. It had to do with funerals. Specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals. But Lindenbaum, who continues to But Lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldn't be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups. She also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades. But here's the bigger question, says Belay: \"How many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?\" \" Chronic wasting disease in North America is spreading fast,\" says Belay. The disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. \"In early 2000, we had about three states that reported CWD in the wild in deer and elk. Today , that number is 21.\" But women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. \"Snacks,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They ate what their mothers gave them,\" she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. \"Then, they were told not to touch that stuff.\" \"So, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body \u2014 taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says Shirley Lindenbaum , a medical anthropologist with the City University of New York. But, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases. But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic. So in 1961, Lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue. The process was so odd that The process was so odd that some compared it to Dr. Jekyll's transformation to Mr. Hyde: \"the same entity but in two manifestations \u2014 a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one.\" As As another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. The so-called \"prions,\" or \"proteinaceous infectious particles,\" would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge. Though the Fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects. The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease. For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, Nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.

According to According to Michael Alpers , a medical researcher at Curtin University in Australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009. His team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over. \"I have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru,\" he wrote in an email.

{"pred": "Are Lefties Really More Creative? The left-handed brand has come a long way in the last few decades. The majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of Satan, alight with hellfire. Today\u2019s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. We associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. But are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? Does being left-handed really make you more creative? Some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask. A handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all. But \"Are lefties different?\" might not even be the right question. Over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it\u2019s not which hand is dominant that matters\u2014it\u2019s the degree of dominance. According to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it\u2019s more of a spectrum. We use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks. Scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They\u2019ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They\u2019ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they\u2019re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated. These experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. They seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people\u2019s perspectives. When considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. They may even sleep differently. It seems we\u2019ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left. But who knows? This is ever-changing, constantly evolving science. If you\u2019re a lefty who enjoys feeling superior, we\u2019re not going to tell you to tone it down. For all we know, you could be right. Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

{"pred": "Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight. While the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.) OK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them. The 100 trillion microbes that live in your gut know -- and influence -- you from the inside out. So what can they tell you about yourself? Here's a taste... \"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\" What Your Gut Bacteria Say About You \"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\" Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO. (But burger lovers, be heartened: Scientists are working on ways to identify and eventually target the villain bacteria.) Try this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers. A bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned. Good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota. \"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\" \"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\" \"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\" \"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\" By Jena Pincott \"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\""}
{"pred": "Whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. \"There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,\" Campbell says. \"There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there\u2019s no distress.\" Having a disease associated with pain doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes\u2014and the medicine usually works. \"If they\u2019re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,\" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that\u2019s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon\u2014which is commonly called a death rattle\u2014probably doesn\u2019t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it\u2019s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. \"We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you\u2019re not really responsive, that your perception\u2014how you feel about things\u2014may also be significantly decreased,\" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. \"You may or may not even be aware of what\u2019s happening.\" * * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother\u2019s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. Once, I captured her hands in mine and asked what she\u2019d been doing. \"Putting things away,\" she answered, smiling dreamily. This half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people\u2019s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The \"patients\u2019 pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. Twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. (Patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) For most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive. The researchers say the dreams often helped decrease the fear of death. \"The predominant quality of pre-death dreams/visions was a sense of personal meaning, which frequently carried emotional significance for the patient,\" they report. There\u2019s good reason. \"Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they\u2019re experiencing,\" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the \u2018event horizon,\u2019 apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying\u2014the last few days or moments\u2014remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. \"Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\" For those who do die gradually, there\u2019s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life\u2014a phase known as \"active dying.\" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. \"First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.\" * * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, \"the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,\" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills\u2014and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. \"The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea.\" \"As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,\" Hovda explains. \"And so that\u2019s where people begin to see light.\" Recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain\u2019s response to dying. Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. \"A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,\" she says. \"They see lights and then they describe the experience as \u2018realer than real.\u2019\" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. \"Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,\" she says. The rats\u2019 brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence\u2014the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. \"If you\u2019re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face\u2014when you\u2019re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,\" Borjigin says. \"These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. So, we thought, if you\u2019re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. In fact, that was the case.\" \"Do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down?\" My mother and I sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents\u2019 Colorado home. It was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. A month or two earlier, she\u2019d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to Australia with my father. Now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. My mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor\u2019s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. Still, we weren\u2019t prepared for the nurse\u2019s question. My mother and I exchanged glances, a little shocked. But what we felt most was a sense of relief. During six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics\u2014not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died."}

Dogs have to be leashed while on campus, and attended by their owner. They aren\u2019t allowed near food areas, for sanitary reasons. If a meeting is on the schedule, the owner has to get a co-worker to keep an eye on the dog. In some cases, dog owners have been relocated to accommodate a neighbor with an allergy or other aversion to dogs. Nvidia\u2019s puppy love began informally several years ago, when one worker asked Huang if he could bring his dog to work. Sure, the CEO said: \"I used to have a dog myself. I\u2019d go home from work to see the dog during lunch.\" Cats, alas, are not welcome at Nvidia, or any other company we\u2019re aware of, because they\u2019re less comfortable in unfamiliar places\u2014and they occasionally provoke the dogs. Besides, the cat probably enjoys the solitude when the dog\u2014and its owner\u2014go to work. As our cameras rolled, several dogs frolicked in the grass, each seemingly comfortable with the others. Dog feuds are rare, Nvidia employees told us. Most dogs adjust quickly to the new digs once they start coming to work, and owners bring beds or blankets to cozy up on the floors of their cubicles, where dogs loll much of the day. Naps are often interrupted by co-workers or visitors who want to play. Since the Silicon Valley tech company occupies a sprawling, low-rise campus, there\u2019s plenty of outdoor space for letting the dogs out, as evident in the video above.

But the closest the GOP ever had to a black Trump, 2012 contender Herman Cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public. Moreover, so much of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that \u2014 despite the thought exercise above \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. Trump\u2019s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his \"law and order\" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president\u2019s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment. In a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way they've treated President Obama. An intellectual, Ivy League-educated, cool-tempered family man, Obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-Christ, a crypto-Muslim Manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy America. Meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model Melania Trump would make an ideal first lady slam Michelle Obama\u2019s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a Maoist reeducation scheme. My point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn Donell have embraced Donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. Replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with African American ghetto vernacular and they\u2019d call the man a \"thug.\" Which brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society.

Presented with such a presidential candidate \u2014 one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence \u2014 how would the Republican Party base and conservative entertainment industry respond?

Would Rush Limbaugh insist that Donell Trump\u2019s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? Or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of Ebonics? \" A racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. f t Granted, if conservatives rejected Donell Trump as unfit for office, they wouldn\u2019t be in the wrong.

A notorious adulterer, Donell Trump has fathered five children with three different wives. Over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, \"fat,\" \"ugly\" and \"pigs\"; he told one female journalist she had \"the face of a dog.\" Then there\u2019s money. Donell Trump can\u2019t get enough of it. He\u2019s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. Donell Trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence \u2014 shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs \u2014 resembles that of a rap star.

Not only does it help most people wake up in the morning, it also has a lot of health benefits. But how much do we know about coffee? How much should we be drinking, and how much are Americans actually drinking? Read the rest of the findings here to learn more about American coffee consumption patterns. And if you're worried about how much coffee is okay to consume -- you might be surprised by how much is \"allowed\" in one day. The new 2015 dietary guidelines the government just released say 3 to 5 cups of coffee are okay, as long as you don't add cream, milk or sugar. How much do Americans pay, on average, for a coffee drink? $3.28, higher than 2013 and 2014. Men go for regular coffee (30 percent) followed by espresso (14 percent). What kind of sweeteners do Americans add to their coffee? Luckily, the folks at Zagat have some of the answers. They just released the results from their third annual coffee study, which highlights consumers' coffee habits. What kind of drink does the average American man order? What kind of drink does the average American woman order? Lattes (22 percent), followed by regular coffee (19 percent) and cappuccinos (12 percent). Check out more of the Zagat findings below and see how your coffee consumption compares: 52 percent of people said they don't add sweeteners, 14 percent of people use Splenda, 7 percent of people use white sugar, 4 percent of people use Stevia and 3 percent of people use simple/flavored syrup."}

We\u2019re confident that our legal system is as adept as we are at detecting scammers and will dismiss this case in short order.\" Late last week, Avalos and an unspecified group of other plaintiffs who say their photos were used to make phony accounts filed a $1.5 billion class-action suit against Match.com\u2019s parent company, IAC (InterActiveCorp), in Manhattan federal court, according to the Post. The company was previously sued for allowing phony Match.com profiles. In 2011, a group of former Match.com users filed a class-action lawsuit in Dallas, alleging the site purposely misled users by allowing millions of fake or outdated profiles. The case was later dismissed, and a Dallas District Court decided that Match.com is not required to \"police, vet, update website content.\" Avalos told The New York Daily News these phony profiles allegedly led to tragedy for one Match.com user. Al Circelli, a 70-year-old Yonkers, N.Y., resident, was reportedly fooled by a fake profile that used Avalos\u2019 modeling pictures. Apparently, \"Aisha\" told Circelli she needed him to send her money to Ghana. That\u2019s not because Avalos is an online dating enthusiast \u2014 it\u2019s because Match.com allegedly allowed more than 200 fake profiles to post Avalos\u2019 pictures, according to the New York Post. Now, the part-time model is taking legal action. \"Not a day goes by when someone doesn\u2019t tell me that they saw my pictures posted on Match.com or another [website],\"  says Miami model Yuliana Avalos. \"The woman who he thought he was talking to was begging him for money and he finally went broke,\" she told the Daily News. \"He had to borrow money from his son. He went bankrupt. He lost everything. He was so ashamed that he killed himself.\" According to Avalos\u2019 lawyer, these phony accounts are easily preventable with the right software, ABC News reports. The Post notes the plaintiffs are seeking a court to mandate Match.com monitor international IP addresses to prevent international users from creating domestic accounts.

{"pred": "Here's How Obama's Female Staffers Made Their Voices Heard And even when they\u2019d made it into the room, female staffers were sometimes overlooked. So they banded together (shine theory!) and came up with a system to make sure they were heard: \"We just started doing it, and made a purpose of doing it. It was an everyday thing,\" said one former Obama aide who requested anonymity to speak frankly. Obama noticed, she and others said, and began calling more often on women and junior aides. When President Obama first took office, the White House wasn\u2019t exactly the friendliest place for female staffers. Most of Obama\u2019s senior staffers \u2014 such as former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former economic adviser Lawrence Summers \u2014 were men who\u2019d worked on his campaign and subsequently filled his cabinet. As the Post points out, things have gotten much better for female staffers in Obama\u2019s second term. There\u2019s an even gender split among his top aides, and half of all White House departments are headed by women. \"I think having a critical mass makes a difference,\" White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said. \"It\u2019s fair to say that there was a lot of testosterone flowing in those early days. Now we have a little more estrogen that provides a counterbalance.\" Female staffers adopted a meeting strategy they called \"amplification\": When a woman made a key point, other women would repeat it, giving credit to its author. This forced the men in the room to recognize the contribution \u2014 and denied them the chance to claim the idea as their own. \"If you didn\u2019t come in from the campaign, it was a tough circle to break into,\" Anita Dunn, who served as White House communications director until November 2009, told the Washington Post. \"Given the makeup of the campaign, there were just more men than women.\" Susan Rice, who\u2019s currently the national security adviser, said she (and other women) had to shoulder their way into important conversations: \"It\u2019s not pleasant to have to appeal to a man to say, \u2018Include me in that meeting.\u2019\" Photo: Pete Souza/The White House"}

Obviously, product designers use all sorts of aesthetic design cues to make things look fancier than they really are, but in this case, it\u2019s downright deceptive. Mostly though, it\u2019s amusing. The cans are so dainty, Beats felt the need to beef em up a little. Beats by Dre headphones are garbage. Besides their crappy sound, they\u2019re basically designed to break. And yet they sell millions of pairs of headphones. It\u2019s practically a perfect business: Take crap and sell it for a fortune. How do they do it? In part it\u2019s marketing, and you know, Dr. Dre. But there\u2019s more. The sneaky designers at Beats by Dre employ a clever trick to make you think that the company\u2019s plastic headphones are durable products worth the premium price. Sponsored A detailed teardown (via PopMech) of a pair of Beats\u2019 immensely popular Solo headphones conducted by hardware-focused venture capital firm Bolt has some answers buried beneath. The headphones are incredibly cheaply made. The company cuts corners everywhere it can; gluing pieces together instead of using screws, and reducing the amount of tooling wherever possible. Amazingly, for all the company\u2019s claims about precision sound design, the headphones use freaking off-the-shelf drivers! None of this is all that surprising because Beats are, after all, terrible and fragile. The crazy part is that the headphones are so cheap that Beats actually needs to add weight to make them feel heftier. From the Medium post: One of the great things about the solo headphones is how substantial they feel. A little bit of weight makes the product feel solid, durable, and valuable. One way to do this cheaply is to make some components out of metal in order to add weight. In these headphones, 30% of the weight comes from four tiny metal parts that are there for the sole purpose of adding weight. Here is an image illustrating this point: On the left, all of the components that actually do something. On the right, four pieces of metal designed specifically to add weight to the product.

Solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. They Solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. They showed that to be true during President George W. Bush\u2019s successful campaign for reelection against John F. Kerry, now the secretary of state, in 2004, and Solomon\u2019s new research with Cohen has produced similar results for Trump. The reminders aren\u2019t explicit, and they probably aren\u2019t part of an intentional strategy. All the same, much of Trump\u2019s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers\u2019 omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to Sheldon Solomon, a psychologist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. \"It sure seems like an existentially shaky historical moment where it has become increasingly difficult for the average American to perceive that they have any basis for either meaning or self-worth,\" Solomon said. \"It is a factor, and in a very close election, it could matter.\" That includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon\u2019s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him. Study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for Trump 1.66 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally. On television and on the stump, at debates and in speeches, Donald Trump is reminding the American people that they are going to die. \"I\u2019m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring,\" Solomon said. Their research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven\u2019t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death. They rated participants\u2019 support for Trump on a scale out of five points based on their answers to several questions. The average rating for those who had been reminded of their mortality was 3.8 points, but it was just 2.2 points for those who had been asked to think about pain. The pattern extends to religious beliefs. The pattern extends to religious beliefs. Another study found a comparable effect in atheists confronted with arguments in favor of intelligent design, and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistencies in the Bible made thoughts of death also more accessible to fundamentalist Christians. Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. A different group of researchers found that after a group of Canadians read an article in which Canadian cultural tropes were mocked, they were thinking about death, too. \"It was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof,\" Solomon said. He and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation. Solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology.

He and his colleagues have argued that the same is true of clothing and grooming, and that humans conceal their nature as animals from themselves to avoid thinking about their mortality. Then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about. Shown \"C O F F _ _,\" for example, many people might write \"COFFEE,\" especially students in college. If they were thinking about death, however, they might write \"COFFIN\" instead. The participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too \u2014 almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly. For example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death. Solomon and Cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the College of Staten Island to respond to one of three prompts. One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration. Solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island. Assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study."}

From the Tromp family's bizarre road trip to the Bangladeshi boy who looks like an old man \u2014 the mysterious news stories of 2016 prove truth can be stranger than fiction. At the time, one police officer described it as \"the most bizarre case in 30 years\". The FBI announced this year that one of America's most baffling crimes \u2014 that of hijacker Dan \"DB Cooper\" who jumped out of a plane with a parachute and ransom money 45 years ago \u2014 looks set to remain an enigma. The FBI said after one of the longest and most exhaustive probes in its history, it would no longer actively investigate the case. This year it was reported that doctors were at a loss to explain the mysterious illness making a four-year-old Bangladeshi boy look like an old man. The symptoms are similar to those suffered by Hollywood actor Brad Pitt's character in the film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. \"It's possible it's an infectious disease process, but so far we haven't been able to pinpoint that.\" Ella and Mitchell spoke to the media, saying their disappearance was \"hard to explain\" and referred to the situation as a \"family matter\". Hundreds of kangaroos were found dead in far west New South Wales this year from what was described as a \"mystery disease\". Here are some of the most baffling tales. Police found the house unlocked, with paperwork everywhere. Reports of lights occurring during earthquakes date back thousands of years, with similar accounts also emerging after the Christchurch earthquake in 2011. The search for the family came to an end when Mark was found on a street near Wangaratta airport in \"good health\". Nothing was heard from him ever again. Cooper gave the flight attendant a glimpse of wires and red-coloured sticks inside his case, the FBI said. There were sightings of between 5-50 dead kangaroos at a time. During the flight, DB Cooper gave a flight attendant a note indicating he had a bomb in his briefcase. People who said they witnessed the sky light up said it occurred at the peak of the earthquake. Despite there being good feed and plenty of water around, something undetectable was knocking the roos off. Their mother Jacoba was found the next day in Yass \u2014 where she too was assessed for stress-related concerns. Once the plan had landed in Seattle, he exchanged the flight's 36 passengers for the money and parachutes. The family's car was later pulled over in Wangaratta, after police received a report it was following another car, and a man, believed to be Mark, ran away into a nearby park. Former NSW Department of Primary Industry veterinarian Greg Curran suggested those figures indicated there were between 100-500 dead in any particular area. Doctors at a top hospital in the capital Dhaka agreed to try to diagnose and treat Bayezid Shikdar for free after learning of his plight. One day later he left the family trip at Bathurst, describing his parents as scared, paranoid and worried they were being followed. But somewhere along the way, he jumped from the back of the plane with a parachute and the money. He asked her to write a note and take it to the plane's captain, demanding parachutes and $US200,000. When a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck near Christchurch in November, videos emerged that appeared to show the New Zealand sky lighting up in blue and green. Bayezid was born with excess skin hanging from his limbs and face, and also suffers from related heart, vision and hearing problems. \"The lights happened right on the peak of the shaking ... [and were] of colours mainly green and blue and white, but a bit of yellow and other colour was there too [sic],\" said the uploader of one video, Zachary Bell. The two girls left their parents at Goulburn, where Riana was hospitalised with stress-related issues. As they drove towards NSW, Mitchell's phone was thrown out the car window. A paper published in science journal Seismological Research Letters hypothesised that the phenomenon was a result of positive charge generated along stress gradients that \"accumulate at the surface\". Meanwhile, Mitchell and Ella had made their way back to Victoria to find police at their home. Doctors initially suspected he suffered from progeria, which causes rapid and premature ageing shortly after birth. In August this year, Mark and Jacoba Tromp and their adult children Ella, Riana and Mitchell left their home in Silvan, east of Melbourne, taking cash but leaving behind bank cards and mobile phones. With several crew members still on board, he ordered the plane to fly to Mexico City. \"All the work we've done says it's not a plant poisoning and it's certainly not starvation,\" he said.

{"pred": "Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through \"work-release.\" Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release. After serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a saute\u0301 cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky. The fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. VICE chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison. That said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between. I had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. They asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what I did to get all that time. My boss was a good boss. He helped me get my Class A driver's license so I could drive trucks for him. He was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job I have now. The farm was a tight-knit family, so I was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. It prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. It didn't kill me and it made me stronger. That job sucked, but I was still glad to have it because I wouldn't be in the position I'm in today otherwise. I've had four jobs since I've been out, and I never told anyone I was on parole until after I was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me. I eventually started my own business, subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties. I could go back to the dump if I wanted, but that job sucked. My first job out of prison was the worst job available in Colombia, Missouri. I was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. I had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. Some days I walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. The halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and I had to walk there every morning. It was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. I had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 PM, with only a short lunch break in between. With my first paycheck, I bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. I was making about 50 bucks a day, but I was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. If I bought a soda or cigarettes I was almost broke. It took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car. I worked there because it was the only job available. Nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. No one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. And all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke K2 all day while I was working. I was alienated out there. It was one of the most degrading experiences I ever went through, but I got past it. It sure didn't help me become a better person cause I was still the same after. I worked with mostly young people, and there were also a bunch of ex-cons working there. Anybody could have got hired at this place, but the conditions were terrible. You had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift. If you went to get a Coke, you had to clock out. If you went to the bathroom, you had to clock out. If you didn't kiss ass, you were an outsider. There was a lot of favoritism, and also a big turnover within staff, of course. Dudes would curse out the boss. One dude even jumped up, picked up a computer, and slammed it down because he couldn't get anybody to donate. He walked out shortly after. But most ex-cons needed the job to get out of the halfway house, so they just kept working there until something better came along. I quit that job when I had something better lined up. It served its purpose because if you don't have a gig you have to stay at the halfway. I've had like seven or eight jobs since then. I've done a lot of different things, but that was the worst. I'm a machinist now, and I assemble parts all day at a machine. It's easier and the pay is better, but I am always looking for something better. Served 10 Years for Drug Conspiracy Served 14 Years for a Drug Conspiracy It wasn't hard getting a job when I came home, it just wasn't a good job. I started working the same week I was released at this telemarketing place that hired ex-cons at $7.25 an hour. You had to be there talking to people on the phone all day, cold calling, trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country. It was cool at first, but after a while I was starting to feel like a robot. The worst job I had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. I had to be there from about 6 AM to 5 PM every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house I was placed in. It wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. Dealing with cows everyday is messy, and I'd have to clean out their living pens.

I called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. I had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. After about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. When I did my final inspection of the morning at 10 AM, the cow had died. All that work was for nothing. Having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. You work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf.

They've wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay. A seemingly obscure legal decision was reached this week, but it affects our use and enjoyment of the Internet, and ensures that we won't be charged more for it. The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality. Opposition also came from the major technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix. The Internet Association , the organization representing nearly 40 tech companies, including those above, also filed a formal petition in opposition. They want companies to compete by being able to attract customers based on their products and services, not on speed of access. Net neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It\u2019s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It\u2019s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined. Three years ago when these rules were being formulated by the FCC, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. Four million citizens emailed and called the FCC objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. When comedian John Oliver explained on HBO\u2019s \"Last Week Tonight\" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes. It was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay.

Not much has been revealed about the next film in the historic franchise, but it seems a leak of the potential title has given us plenty of cause for speculation. In a video that seems to show some kind of Star Wars celebration, an apparent poster depicts Episode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance. Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 Fall Of The Resistance (Possibly) So What Is Your Favorite Star Wars Working Title? The apparent leaked title of the next installment is Fall of the Resistance. Whether this is the actual title or a working title is a mystery in itself, but Episode VIII already has a working title, according to Carrie Fisher \u2014 Space Bear: Episode VIII. No, this is not a joke. Fisher tweeted out a photo of her adorable dog sitting on a chair with this supposed headline. Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack Of The Clones Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace Indeed, Star Wars has a long history of doing this. Check out some of the working titles the franchise has utilized over the years. With each Star Wars temporary name, there are some funny ones and definitely some weird ones. Each one is unique and shows just how fascinating it must be to be a part of the on-set moviemaking magic. The Force Awakens was easily one of the most anticipated films of ALL TIME. Unfortunately, the working title was not as fun as its previous counterparts. It was titled after J.J. Abrams' production company and was referred to as Episode VII: Foodles. A bit adolescent I know, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless. Highly regarded as one of the best films of all time, Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi is a pop culture classic. It was so popular that Family Guy titled the first part of its Star Wars trilogy after Episode VI's working title. Of course, I am referring to the infamous Blue Harvest, which was the name that was used during production of Return of the Jedi \u2014 and a name that will always be etched in the minds of Star Wars fanatics everywhere. Episode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance. This is when things started to get a bit better with the prequels. Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones brought us the lovable Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also brought us one of the most hated characters ever in Jar Jar Binks. And this is pretty ironic, considering the working title for Episode II was Episode II: Jar Jar's Big/Great Adventure. Could you imagine if Lucasfilm actually ran with this? The backlash would have been insurmountable and I don't think it would have every recovered from that. #HailJarJar! Ahh, Episode I, how hyped you were. But that is beside the point. While the title The Phantom Menace had many fans wishing they could forget, that was not always the title that was used on set. The original was Episode I: The Beginning. Pretty fitting, since it really is the beginning story of the world that we know and love. Personally, I liked this title much more than The Phantom Menace and I think they should have stuck with it. Pretty adorable, and the whole crew seems to really be having a great time working on Episode VIII. #SpaceBear2017! If this is truly the title, we will definitely be in for an interesting storyline. However, I don't think this is the new movie's name, but merely a working title that the production staff are using while on set."}
{"pred": "The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates. Earth was born about 4.5 billion years ago, and scientists think the moon formed shortly afterward. The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth's Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)] \"By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,\" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com. This finding suggests that, one day, it may be possible to find samples of what the primordial Earth was like before the giant impact that formed the moon, or to uncover bits of the impacting rock itself. \"To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. The cataclysmic collision between Earth and a Mars-size object that forged the moon may have occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, suggests a study of meteorites with ancient fragments from that cosmic impact. \"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\" This research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology \u2014 we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.\" However, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts. To find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble \u2014 as much as several percent of Earth's mass \u2014 away from Earth and the moon. \"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\" If future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, \"possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,\" Bottke said. The simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact \u2014 hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long \u2014 blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said. Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact. The scientists detailed their findings in the April 17 issue of the journal Science. \"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids.\""}

Growing marijuana plants, imbibing the drug in any form and dealing it are still forbidden. Switzerland Decriminalizes Marijuana, Won't Prosecute For Small Amounts Of Weed As of Oct. 1, possession of marijuana is decriminalized in Switzerland. Lawmakers in the country relaxed weed regulations in an effort to unify what had been a patchwork of often confusing policies that varied from one local area to another. Per The Independent, the measure is also expected to save money by cutting back on the 30,000 marijuana-related cases courts have had to handle each year. It will also free up police resources to pursue larger drug trafficking incidents. Penalties are now stricter for anyone caught selling to a person under the age of 18. The new law also provides greater resources to help children with marijuana habits. A 2013 UNICEF report found Swiss children are the world's second-most likely to smoke marijuana, with just over 24 percent of 11, 13 and 15-year-olds having smoked pot in the last year. For perspective, Canada leads the world in kids' marijuana use, with 28 percent of its children aged 11, 13, and 15 admitting to smoking pot in the past 12 months. Anyone over the age of 18 caught with 10 grams or less of the drug will no longer have to make a court appearance and will not have offenses entered into their permanent record; instead, violators will have to pay a fine of 100 Swiss Francs (approximately $110), then be on their way."}

{"pred": "The iPhone 5C Number Apple Doesn't Want You To Know With Android-run smartphones made by Samsung and Google cutting into Apple's market share, many see the global appetite for Apple smartphones waning. But preorder numbers for iPhone 5C, even if they are low, may not be the best indication. On Monday, Apple managed to make a bit of news by not announcing any. For the first time, the iPhone maker didn't reveal how many preorders were made on its new line of smartphones. The silence on orders for the iPhone 5C -- a week after it was announced -- has investors down on the tech giant. It\u2019s just that instead of putting the year-old iPhone 5 in slot #2, they\u2019ve created the 5C to debut in that slot. The 5C is, effectively, an iPhone 5. Same A6, same camera, same just about everything \u2014 except for the most obvious difference, its array of colorful plastic shells ... What changes with the 5C is that the middle tier is suddenly more appealing, and has a brand of its own that Apple can promote apart from the flagship 5S. But circumstances may be a bit different this year. For one, Apple's top-line phone, the iPhone 5S, can't be preordered. If you want it the first day it's on sale, you have to wait in line -- creating yet another organic marketing tool for Apple. The company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales. As many others have pointed out, the iPhone 5C is essentially a rebranded iPhone 5 with nearly all the same specs. John Gruber, a well-regarded Apple observer, thinks it's a clever marketing move for Apple's second-tier phone: For now, Apple will keep plugging away at the 5C. Here's a new one released on Monday: By creating the perception of scarcity, Apple's tactic worked to get some consumers off the fence about buying a new iPhone. But this year, Apple was mum about preorder numbers several days after iPhone 5C preorders went live. This didn't go unnoticed by Wall Street. With investors interpreting Apple's silence as weak initial 5C sales, Apple's stock slid to $450 on Monday from Friday's close of $465. Since 2010, Apple's media blitz for its new iPhone has gone like this: On a Friday following the big unveil event, people can begin preordering the new phone, The Verge points out. A few days later, Apple trumpets the high number of new iPhones the public wants. In 2010, more than 600,000 iPhone 4s were preordered in 24 hours. By the time the iPhone 5 was released two years later, that preorder figure was 2 million."}

NERD is \"fundamentally involved in remaking the form and purposes of state government, and the interests who benefit from that financially would certainly have an interest in supporting it financially,\" Rich Robinson, head of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, told the Detroit Free Press. Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, told The Huffington Post that the fund had \"had simply become an unnecessary distraction.\" But she was confident that it had obeyed applicable state and federal laws, none of which require donor names to be disclosed, and \"all state and federal tax and election laws and regulations were met and followed closely.\" In 2011, the secretive fund raised more than $1.3 million. But there's been a sharp drop-off in donations for 2012, with only $368,000 being raised, according to a copy of the 2012 IRS return obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Rick Snyder Will Shut Down Secret Michigan NERD Fund, Still Hasn't Revealed Donors \"Republican Gov. Snyder should keep his promises of transparency and immediately disclose which corporate special interests are backing the NERD Fund,\" Lon Johnson, Michigan Democratic Party Chair, added in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. She confirmed that a new fund to solicit donations \"will go far above and beyond what the law requires\" -- including full disclosure of donors, gift amounts and expenditure details. She also defended Snyder's need for the fund to subsidize additional government expenses. Gov. Rick Snyder (R-Michigan) will shut down a secret fund that paid salaries to his trusted advisors, living expenses for Detroit's emergency manager, and new furniture and security for the Governor's residences, one of his spokepersons confirmed to The Huffington Post. There's still no word on whether Gov. Snyder will make the names of donors to the NERD Fund public. A new website, SecretiveSnyder.com, asks, \"When will Snyder come clean?\" The \"NERD\" fund, an acronym for \"New Energy to Reinvent and Diversify Fund,\" is a nonprofit, but all the donors' names have been kept anonymous from the public. Gov. Snyder testified in bankruptcy court last week that he did not know any of their identities. \"Shutting down this slush fund in an attempt to avoid transparency only raises more red flags,\" said Michigan State AFL-CIO President Karla Swift in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. Rich DiBartolomeo was Snyder's deputy campaign manager and director of finance. He was paid $48,366 for 10 hours of weekly work as Assistant Secretary and Treasurer of the NERD fund (the 501 (c)4's only paid employee of 2011.) At the same time, he was also collecting a salary from Gov. Snyder's campaign committee, according to Citizensforethics.org. He left both positions in June 2012 for another government job: a $115,000-a-year position as the investment administrator for the Michigan Treasury Department (which manages cities and school districts in financial emergencies). How was the NERD Fund money spent? Snyder still has a solid lead over gubernatorial opponent Mark Schauer in the 2014 election, according to a recent poll published by MIRS. But the fund has become one of the biggest controversies in the Michigan governor's tenure. $100,000 in consulting fees to MI Partners LLC. Gov. Snyder was the sole client of the consulting firm run by Rich Baird, who Gov. Snyder calls his \"transformation manager,\" according to the Detroit News. Baird, a Snyder adviser who was the architect of the governor's successful campaign team, retired as a global partner from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Baird was appointed a state employee on Wednesday, according to the Detroit News. He will take home an annual salary of $140,000. \"There\u2019s an independent board that does that work,\" Snyder said under oath, according to the Detroit News. $130,638 spent on a security system and new furniture for the state-owned residences used by Gov.

The condo is rented at a price of $4,200 per month; the fund also paid for travel expenses for Orr to see his family, which resides in Maryland. Wurfel told the Detroit Free Press that one of the fund's stated purposes is to offset the cost of governance. Orr's salary is $275,000. \"Given the financial straits of the city, the limited resources of the state, and the very big and challenging job that Kevyn was hired to do, it was deemed appropriate and necessary to help save taxpayer dollars,\" Wurfel said."}

We\u2019ve seen this story before in Louisiana, and we don\u2019t deserve a sequel. In 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing President George W. Bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The current president was among those making political hay out of Bush\u2019s aloofness.

His stubborn refusal to rebut claims regarding what was in the Affordable Care Act badly hamstrung his party's attempt to win the fight for public perception on the law. His unwillingness to say the words \"radical Islamic terror\" have become a hobbyhorse for conservatives and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. And so on and so forth. Still, it's worth noting this moment. And that's because it speaks to Obama's unique and long-lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics: making at least some decisions based on \"how it looks\" and/or \"how it will play.\" Two important things happened today in the political world of President Obama.

What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction... ...There has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn\u2019t use the label \"radical Islam.\" Not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around.

Wellington-based journalist Ben Collins asks whether New Zealand is becoming a \"utopia\" for Americans looking to leave. Recently, the New Yorker magazine ran a piece titled Doomsday Prep for the Super-rich. It detailed the rise in wealthy investors who see New Zealand as their escape from a volatile world. \"It's a country with a similar land mass to Britain but with 4.4 million people.\" \"There's just a feeling that people want to create a bolthole in the southern hemisphere that's away from some of the problems facing the Western world,\" he says.

Better lifestyle When the New Zealand Herald revealed this week that Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel had become a citizen and purchased a lake-front estate it perhaps shouldn't have been a surprise. New Zealand recently overtook Singapore as the best place to do business, according to the World Bank. Transparency International ranks it as the world's least corrupt country, and the 2016 Global Peace Index said it was the fourth safest behind Iceland, Denmark and Austria. \"I think New Zealand and the United States are very similar,\" she said. \"For him it's got excellent skills, excellent talent, and what was previous a boundary (distance)... with modern technology you're connected to the world all the time. The temperate, mountainous country is also comparably well-placed to deal with rising sea levels, and its most recent major attack was in 1985, when French spies blew up a Greenpeace vessel in Auckland harbour. It isn't just the mega-wealthy that are attracted to New Zealand. Sarah Coombes-Crome, an immigration consultant, said that traffic to her firm's website was up approximately 600% the day after Donald Trump won the election and has remained higher than average. \"I am aware of the recent commentary around Mr Thiel, but there is no evidence of any backlash against migrant investors coming in. What we do know is that many of the investors who come out deliver significant value in the form of job creation in the communities. \"It's a combination of our marketing effort, and a bit of global uncertainty that means New Zealand is a pretty attractive place,\" Mr McGill said. \"We are a small island nation at the bottom of the world with lots of resources and opportunities and we need to maximise that, and some of the way we can do that is bringing in investors,\" he said. The revelation that Mr Thiel had quietly become a New Zealand citizen has raised some questions about the processes for foreign investors, with some politicians asking how, exactly, he was able to secure it and whether he was given special treatment.

We can always expect her to be sporting an amazing lip color. (Right now her current fave is Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in Love That Red.) However, it takes more than just a single swipe of face makeup for her to get flawless skin. \"I have two foundations that I put on every day,\" Lauren told us. \"My mom used to do it. She's the one who got me started. People always say, 'Your skin is so smooth.' And I'm like, 'No, it's not. It's because I layered on two foundations.' But it's not really thick.\" To achieve a streak-free finish, Lauren applies a lighter shade as a base to cover up flaws. She lets it sit for a few minutes on the areas that need a little more coverage. (She saw HuffPost Live lead makeup artist Kari Bauce do this trick.) Then Lauren blends the foundation and adds the darker shade to the spots where the sun would hit like the cheeks, temples and chin (another tip she picked up from her mother). This adds a whole new meaning to looking \"lit from within.\""}

Boxed, an online Costco-like retailer, just announced that the company will pay for employee weddings (up to $20,000). This was in addition to last year\u2019s announcement that the company would cover the costs for employees\u2019 kids to attend college. Oh and on top of these two crazy perks, all employees get unlimited sick and vacation time. Some companies, especially in the digital space, are doing amazing things to attract and keep employees. From extended paid maternity leave to free gourmet lunches, companies are thinking up creative ways to make a great work environment and lure talented people. What makes the announcement so great is that unlike some tech companies that provide great perks for already highly paid people in Silicon Valley, the majority of the 125 employees at Boxed are paid hourly and handle shipping and fulfillment. So these types of perks really are life-changing for their employees. Boxed CEO Chieh Huang told The Huffington Post that \"Free snacks get old, I just want to do the stuff that really matters.\" He went on to add that real things like weddings and college are much more important than snacks and ping pong tables. They are also hiring for a wide range of jobs right now."}

{"pred": "White Wine And Beer Are Sources Of Arsenic In Diets, Study Finds One possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic. It is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, Cottingham said. White wine, beer and Brussels sprouts can be major sources of the toxic metal arsenic in people's diets, according to a new study. People who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink. The study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, Cottingham said. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health] Of the 120 foods the researchers looked at, four turned out to significantly raise people's arsenic levels: beer, white wine (and to a lesser extent, red wine), Brussels sprouts and dark-meat fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines, according to the study, published last week (Nov. 16) in the Nutrition Journal. \"The mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption,\" Cottingham said. And lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic. It's also important to keep water sources safe, she said. \"If someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested. Water is something we are drinking and using every day,\" Cottingham said. \"So knowing what your water exposure is, I think, is a big piece of the puzzle.\" People who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month. Researchers analyzed the diets of 852 people in New Hampshire, and the levels of arsenic in their toenails, which show long-term exposure to the chemical. The most significant source of arsenic in most people's diets is drinking water. The new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods. The results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said. The researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. But in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels. The element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods. [5 Things You Should Know About Arsenic] Although some foods are high in arsenic, people don't need to avoid them entirely, Cottingham said. \"Probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day.\" The arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. However, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author Kathryn Cottingham, researcher at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. In the study, the arsenic levels in the participants' household tap water were well below the EPA limit, at 0.30 micrograms per liter, on average. However, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the EPA's limits. The toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said."}
{"pred": "JPMorgan To Settle With U.S., UK Regulators For 'London Whale' Losses The settlement, which is expected to be for at least $700 million, would resolve several civil probes into the multibillion-dollar trading losses at the largest U.S. bank last year. Regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, are expected to be part of the settlement. U.S. and UK regulators are expected to announce a civil settlement as soon as Thursday of their investigations into JPMorgan Chase & Co's \"London Whale\" derivatives loss, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Following the \"Whale\" scandal, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon faced a bruising battle with some shareholders to retain his chairman title and has since been under pressure to improve the bank's relationship with regulators. Bruno Iksil, the trader whose large bets earned him the nickname \"London Whale,\" has signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors and has not been charged with any wrongdoing. The New York Times reported that the fines would top $900 million. However, U.S. prosecutors are still investigating JPMorgan for potential criminal wrongdoing. A settlement would mark a key step in JPMorgan's efforts to resolve its regulatory and legal troubles. The bank is facing separate probes by various government agencies into areas that include possible bribery in hiring practices in China and potentially fraudulent sales of mortgage securities. Two former bank employees - Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout - have already been charged with trying to hide some of those losses by deliberately giving inaccurate values to the sophisticated securities involved in the trades.

{"pred": "This underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren\u2019t that great. \"It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,\" Allen said. \"It\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s purely the patent that stops us.\" The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. (Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.) But critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: \"If you\u2019re the monopolist, and you\u2019ve got a product that expires every year, and it\u2019s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places \u2014 I don\u2019t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,\" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law. Granted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan\u2019s pricing for years, and complaints about the device\u2019s clunkiness are no secret. But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. That means there\u2019s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation. \"EpiPen\u2019s flaws seem like features, not a bug,\" Price said. But though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design \u2014 or the lack of innovation \u2014 until the product started hitting headlines. \"I guess Mylan\u2019s motto is, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u2019\" Clark said. \"They have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the EpiPen?\" Public anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk. Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it\u2019s finally going to go for it. Though EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. Stepanian agrees that it\u2019s more complicated than it seems at first glance: \"It\u2019s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector \u2014 and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,\" he said. But they\u2019re also bulky. Their epinephrine solution isn\u2019t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. They expire after about a year. And they\u2019re not so user-friendly. Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end\u2019s the pointy end \u2014 and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs. But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust. One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren\u2019t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it\u2019s \"in the process of evaluating when and how\" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market \u2014 but Sanofi is no longer involved. The devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608. Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is \"investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life.\" \"The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this,\" Baum said. \"But when the market was more normalized \u2014 when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 \u2014 competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk.\" Competitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen. And more are trying now that there\u2019s such a spotlight on the product. But it\u2019s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap. A lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis \u2014 a compound pharmaceutical company that\u2019s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen. It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product. Windgap\u2019s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It\u2019s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated. oston mom Denise Clark has been buying EpiPens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy. Problem is, he won\u2019t carry his EpiPen around with him \u2014 because it won\u2019t fit into his pocket. \"We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain \u2014 much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,\" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said. 4. The regulatory process is slow and expensive 3. It doesn\u2019t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body \u2014 but it sure helps The company\u2019s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there\u2019s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack. But that\u2019s proving easier said than done. Stepanian said he\u2019s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market. Allen\u2019s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. Those rules keep consumers safe. But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards \u2014 without infringing on Mylan\u2019s patent. Epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It\u2019s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s. 5. The public hasn\u2019t spoken (loud enough) \"It\u2019s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it \u2014 and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,\" Stepanian added. \"At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.\" 1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025 Here\u2019s why: Chris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that\u2019s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years. In the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it\u2019s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine. 2. There\u2019s no room for error when you\u2019re treating anaphylaxis They\u2019re reliable, sure. They\u2019ll buy a patient who\u2019s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital. \"It\u2019s large and it\u2019s impractical,\" Clark said. \"Where\u2019s he going to put it?\" The same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict \u2014 which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis. MannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. But it\u2019s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they\u2019re familiar with to an inhaler. Sales have been far below expectations. \"It\u2019s something that\u2019s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I\u2019ve looked at it closely \u2014 until I had to start paying all this money,\" Clark said. \"We\u2019re just focused on being that competition,\" he said. Denise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors. She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy. \"If you\u2019re a parent, and your child\u2019s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection \u2014 and don\u2019t want to read the instructions in that moment,\" said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants. \"You just have to know how to use it.\""}
{"pred": "Here's What Donald Trump Rejects When He Undermines the Election Results In what immediately became the headline moment at the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday night, Republican candidate Donald Trump sparked widespread outrage by saying he would keep the nation \"in suspense\" about whether he will accept the results of the election next month. For example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why: \"But, sir, there is a tradition in this country\u2014in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner,\" said moderator Chris Wallace. \"Not saying that you\u2019re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.\" As all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support. This principle\u2014that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice\u2014has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise. That tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME's David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required: Almost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.'' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy. South Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was \"united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.\" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that \"public opinion at the North has invested a great political error\" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome. The rest of the Confederacy would soon follow South Carolina's lead. By April, the Civil War had begun. That doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes. After all, George Washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals\u2014the incumbent Adams as well as Burr\u2014accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the \"revolution of 1800\" was a big deal: Indeed, the nation's ability to regularly and peacefully replace the President was, to the world of the 1700s, one of the most striking elements of the American experiment. As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\" [It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election. But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test."}

The last time you used a \"sick day,\" you were actually sick. Like stuck in bed sick. 22. When someone mentions a hot new app, your mind immediately goes to mobile banking and financial planning. 12. You hardly ever get carded at your local grocery store, but get excited when a new checker doesn\u2019t recognize you and asks for your ID. 18. Going to work after a night of drinking and barely any sleep is no longer an option. 21. You no longer make fun of people who complain about their \"bad backs,\" because you\u2019ve hurt your back before and know that it\u2019s no laughing matter. 11. Not only do you have friends who are married, but you've also got a few who are happily divorced. 24. And know a rollover isn\u2019t just something dogs do. 16. You mix up Kendall and Kylie Jenner. 14. You spend more on kitchen appliances than you do on shoes. 15. You watch Food Network and actually re-create some of the dishes from your favorite shows. 13. You have a preferred type of toilet paper. 23. You know the difference between a traditional and Roth IRA. 17. The last crazy concert you went to was...an opera. And you used to spend BANK on shoes back in the day. Shopping for wedding presents stopped being intimidating years ago. 9. You prioritize things like in-unit laundry while looking at apartments. Who has time to waste hanging out at a laundromat? 4. When your phone rings past 9 p.m. you automatically think it\u2019s an emergency, because really, who calls someone past 9? 6. You spend more time getting ready for bed in the evening than you do getting dressed and styling your hair in the mornings. 3. But binge-watching isn't limited to just sitcoms and dramas. You lost an entire weekend to an HGTV marathon a few months ago. Yet you still felt guilty and even managed to log on to check your email. 10. You can work the wedding registry kiosks at places like Target and Best Buy like a total pro! 5. Your Halloween costumes have become significantly less revealing over the years \u2014 not because you\u2019re less confident with your body but because you\u2019re less willing to endure cold weather in order to look like a sexy mouse. 1. You buy hemp milk not because it\u2019s ironic, but because your digestion isn't what it used to be. And you were legitimately excited when Peet's started offering almond milk. Seriously, why does lactose become such as problem as we get older? 2. You no longer think spending a Friday night at home is lame, and may have even canceled plans to go out last weekend so you could binge-watch Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. 8. And even have an opinion on which you prefer. 7. You know that pinot grigio and pinot gris are two different wines. Odds are it's probably just a reminder call about your upcoming dentist appointment. But hey, at least you realize they're two separate people.

If you\u2019re busy at work you can take a measly 60 seconds to quickly rid yourself of your headache and improve your mood, focus, and energy. A lot of people suffer from headaches. However, they don\u2019t have to let them ruin your day or your concentration! You can relieve 90% of headaches using the quick method suggested by BeYourPotential. All you need to do is applying pressure on your sinuses between your eyes and nose and on the back of your head for 60 seconds. Additionally, headaches can be caused by dehydration. So, just to be sure your headache will go away, drink a few pints of water after you press on these pressure points. It works by opening the main sinus canals leading to your brain. These canals can get blocked by mucus, which is what causes a headache. Relieve Your Sinuses Just be sure to hold those pressure points for a full minute, and do both sides! Skimping on the time might make this method less effective. I hope this method helps you! Good luck, and please be sure to share it so we can help others get some much needed relief!

{"pred": "We are going to name 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn\u2019t Know Came Out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. You may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think Wanda Sykes and Zachary Quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn\u2019t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum. So take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community. We should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. One example is singer Selena Gomez. While she doesn\u2019t identify as an LGBTQ individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. Are there any names on this list that really surprised you? Feel free to share the list on social media! Another celeb who came out in 2016 was singer Ryan Beatty. The 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar YouTube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. Beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. A few months ago, Beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that\u2019s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. His Instagram post included the words \"raging homosexual\" and \"gay power.\" Beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is \"comfortable enough to say it\" and \"can finally breathe.\" The singer also took to the Twitterverse and Tweeted: \"i\u2019m so happy i\u2019m gay\" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. The announcement came right before the release of his single, \"Passion.\" Sometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. So it was with Mara Wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street. Wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that she Tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. Wilson wrote \"F*cking hell, Orlando.\" She then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: \"I have never had a better experience at a club than I did then...the LGBT community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when I, uh, learned something about myself.\" Wilson then pointed out the Kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one\u2019s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. Wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual. The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. More and more states in America are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. Still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. There are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift. Actor Colton Haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the MTV series Teen Wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. Taking to social media, Haynes commented on a Tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about Haynes\u2019 \"secret gay past,\" and that it got them \"so excited.\" Haynes then responded to the Tumblr post, writing \"Was it a secret? Let\u2019s all just enjoy life & have no regrets.\" Many people have assumed that this was Haynes\u2019 way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn\u2019t say he was gay directly. It is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. He certainly made the Tumblr world happy! 15 Kristen Stewart Who didn\u2019t love watching Aubrey Plaza play Andy\u2019s (Chris Pratt\u2019s) girlfriend April on Parks and Recreation? Plaza plays the perfect cynical Debbie Downer character, but the 32-year-old actress\u2019 unique and distinguishable character traits aren\u2019t the only thing that makes her special. Plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender \"isn\u2019t a factor\" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. The actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don\u2019t identify as either. Plaza\u2019s revelation came during an interview with The Advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. Plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very \"androgynous and masculine\" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. She then blatantly stated that she falls in love \"with girls and guys,\" and that she can\u2019t help it. For years, YouTube sensation and funny guy Shane Dawson was suspected of being gay. He would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. Plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people\u2019s gaydar. A few months ago, Dawson released a YouTube video on his channel simply titled \"I\u2019m Bisexual.\" In the video, Dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. He hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they\u2019re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. Stating that, \"I don\u2019t know who I am 100 percent. And I know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way,\" Dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual. Some of you may remember Rayvon Owen from American Idol\u2019s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. The 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his American Idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. Owen released a music video for his song \"Can\u2019t Fight It\" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. In \"Can\u2019t Fight It,\" Owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something\u2019s up. By the end of the music video, Owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. He takes the man\u2019s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. Plus, the other guy in the video was played by Shane Bitney Crone, a pivotal advocate and public figure in the LGBTQ community. Famed and respected news journalist for CNN, Anderson Cooper, has been out as a gay man since 2012, but earlier this year he was thrown for a loop when his own mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, dropped some bombshell information. Vanderbilt spoke during a joint interview alongside Cooper and revealed that when she was a teenager, she had a lesbian relationship with one of her classmates. It was a piece of information that had been unknown to Cooper for his entire life, and the way the journalist reacted was downright adorable, as he shrugged his shoulders at his mom and said, \"What? This is news to me.\" Mother and son shared a cute giggle together and Cooper seemed grateful to know that his own mother had experimented with her sexuality. The whole thing was quite touching, and in fact, Vanderbilt wrote a book with her son which was recently published entitled The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son On Life, Love, and Loss. 14 Aubrey Plaza Actress Kristen Stewart was the other half to actor Robert Pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in Hollywood in the past. Yet in early 2016, Stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. The 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile, and before that, Stewart was dating Soko, French actress and musician. Just two years ago, Stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with Pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, Michael Angarano. Stewart and Cargile have only been dating since July of 2016, but Stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. As for Cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said \"Make America Gay Again.\" It was obviously a direct hit to Presidential candidate, Donald Trump. 10 Shane Dawson 12 Colton Haynes If the name Reid Ewing sounds familiar, that\u2019s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit TV series Modern Family. Ewing plays the role of Dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. The 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. When writing on a guest blog post for HuffPost Healthy Living, Ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to Twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. His tweet read: \"Saw Eugene Bata on @GMA in the Body Dysmorphia segment connected to my article I just want to say he is hot af.\" Someone commented and asked \"Did you just out yourself?\" to which Ewing replied \"I was never in.\" *Drops mic* That\u2019s the way to do it! 13 Mara Wilson 9 Ryan Beatty Nur Warsame is an imam in Australia, and for those of you who don\u2019t know an imam is an Islamic worship or mosque leader in the Muslim faith. Warsame came out at the start of the summer in 2016 and became the first imam in Australia to openly identify as gay. Naturally, Warsame has dealt with an outpouring or both support and hate. There have been a number of mosques in Australia that will not accept Warsame through its doors, while other Muslim leaders have spoken out against Warsame and said that his acceptance of his sexuality is wrong. On the other hand, there have been other leaders and people in the public who have commended Warsame for his actions. Warsame was previously married to a woman and he also has a young daughter. He is now an advocate for other Muslims who may be struggling with their own sexuality.' 11 Reid Ewing 7 Gloria Vanderbilt 8 Rayvon Owen 6 Nur Warsame"}

{"pred": "Is there trouble in paradise? Working and spending each day with your partner can be challenging at the best of times, but we never predicted that Kit Harington's girlfriend would have such thoughts. Despite bagging one of the most sought-after hunks on the small screen, Rose Leslie has pledged to never work with her love again. The 29-year-old redhead had the pleasure of acting as Ygritte alongside her scraggly-haired beau \u2013 who has captured the hearts of many a teenage fangirl \u2013 during her stint in hit television series, Game Of Thrones. Whilst the majority of human kind would be more than happy to spend every living hour with Harington, she's decided she has better things to do. And it looks as though Harington kept the fate of Jon Snow under wraps with his beloved, divulging that she was unaware he'd return to the show following his shock death at the end of series five. Leslie told the Evening Standard: \"I think we leave it at that. We had such a fabulous time working together on Thrones. As much as she loves her boyfriend, Leslie wants to achieve her own success away from the gossip-mongers who feed off her high-profile relationship, which means working on individual projects and carving out a career on her own accord. Insisting she wouldn't like to see her character brought back from the dead, she continued: \"I'm now a little pile of ash. The writers are being incredibly loyal to the books and the way it's developed Jon Snow needs to be on his own and take charge of his own life. I think it's a good thing that she died.\" It's not as if the lovebirds really had the choice of working together on GoTagain, as both of their on-screen alter egos were killed off. Ygritte kicked the bucket after being shot by a child with a bow and arrow, and died in Jon Snow's (Harington) arms, whilst poor Snowy was left for dead after being stabbed multiple times. Grim viewing, to say the least. It was during her 17 episodes on the show that she became Snow's love interest, both on and off screen. Though \"ecstatic\" about his reappearance, she claimed she is \"going to have words\" with him for being so shady about the new season six. She said: \"I had no idea...I was kind of like, just as surprised as the rest of the world when the man woke back up again.\" Watch Game Of Thrones on Sky Atlantic on Monday (16 May) at 9pm. \"I think it's important to do your own projects that mean a lot to you individually, rather than be associated with someone else.

She's also working to be a champion for young women in her situation. \"I didn't think a beauty pageant would want someone like me. It proves you don't need to be a perfect person. It feels nice that I have been chosen having these scars on my face.\" But this story isn't about him: It's about Chantelle, who is recovering beautifully. In fact, she's even joining beauty pageants to help her confidence. Clearly, Chantelle doesn't have any problems winning, despite her perceived flaws.

About forty minutes later, she dropped THIS bombshell: Savannah Guthrie announced on Monday morning that she got married over the weekend. Then, for good measure, she announced she was four months pregnant."}
{"pred": "As the couple head home in the early morning of Sept. 6, somehow through the foggy shock of it all, they make the connection that today, the day they learned what had been festering, is also the day they would have officially kicked off their empty-nestering. The youngest of their three children had just left for college. Jason loves listening to live music; it\u2019s our favorite thing to do together. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else. I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I\u2019m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days. By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him. Jason? He knew a year later. Of course, I would agree \u2014 he was indeed a captivating character. But it was funny because she could have just said: \"Jason. Let\u2019s add more about Jason.\" Let me explain: My father\u2019s best friend since summer camp, \"Uncle\" John, had known Jason and me separately our whole lives, but Jason and I had never met. I went to college out east and took my first job in California. When I moved back home to Chicago, John \u2014 who thought Jason and I were perfect for each other \u2014 set us up on a blind date. If he sounds like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale, it\u2019s not too far off, except for all of the regular stuff that comes from two and a half decades of playing house together. And the part about me getting cancer. Blech. He is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him \u2014 or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes \u2014 know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape. When I was working on my first memoir, I kept circling sections my editor wanted me to expand upon. She would say, \"I\u2019d like to see more of this character.\" She suggested the word \"more.\" This was based on an essay in the book where I mention that \"more\" was my first spoken word (true). And now it may very well be my last (time shall tell). I want more time with Jason. I want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. So why I am doing this? I have been married to the most extraordinary man for 26 years. I was planning on at least another 26 together. It was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, \"Uh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.\" With all my love, Amy I\u2019ll leave this intentional empty space below as a way of giving you two the fresh start you deserve. I was totally serious about this and encouraged submitters to be serious as well. Hundreds poured in. A few weeks after publication in August, I heard from a 62-year-old librarian in Milwaukee named Paulette. Here is the kind of man Jason is: He showed up at our first pregnancy ultrasound with flowers. This is a man who, because he is always up early, surprises me every Sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffeepot: a spoon, a mug, a banana. My guess is you know enough about him now. So let\u2019s swipe right. Want to hear a sick joke? A husband and wife walk into the emergency room in the late evening on Sept. 5, 2015. A few hours and tests later, the doctor clarifies that the unusual pain the wife is feeling on her right side isn\u2019t the no-biggie appendicitis they suspected but rather ovarian cancer. If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food \u2014 man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening\u2019s meal. He is an easy man to fall in love with. I did it in one day. If you\u2019re looking for a dreamy, let\u2019s-go-for-it travel companion, Jason is your man. He also has an affinity for tiny things: taster spoons, little jars, a mini-sculpture of a couple sitting on a bench, which he presented to me as a reminder of how our family began. Jason paints. I love his artwork. I would call him an artist except for the law degree that keeps him at his downtown office most days from 9 to 5. Or at least it did before I got sick. So many plans instantly went poof. In my most recent memoir (written entirely before my diagnosis), I invited readers to send in suggestions for matching tattoos, the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink. No wonder the word cancer and cancel look so similar. In September, Paulette drove down to meet me at a Chicago tattoo parlor. She got hers (her very first) on her left wrist. I got mine on the underside of my left forearm, in my daughter\u2019s handwriting. This was my second tattoo; the first is a small, lowercase \"j\" that has been on my ankle for 25 years. You can probably guess what it stands for. Jason has one too, but with more letters: \"AKR.\" You May Want to Marry My Husband  Wait. Did I mention that he is incredibly handsome? I\u2019m going to miss looking at that face of his. First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes. I am wrapping this up on Valentine\u2019s Day, and the most genuine, non-vase-oriented gift I can hope for is that the right person reads this, finds Jason, and another love story begins. This is when we entered what I came to think of as Plan \"Be,\" existing only in the present. As for the future, allow me to introduce you to the gentleman of this article, Jason Brian Rosenthal. Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use. No trip with my husband and parents to South Africa. No reason, now, to apply for the Harvard Loeb Fellowship. No dream tour of Asia with my mother. No writers\u2019 residencies at those wonderful schools in India, Vancouver, Jakarta. He is an absolutely wonderful father. Ask anyone. See that guy on the corner? Go ahead and ask him; he\u2019ll tell you. Jason is compassionate \u2014 and he can flip a pancake. Still, I have to stick with it, because I\u2019m facing a deadline, in this case, a pressing one. I need to say this (and say it right) while I have a) your attention, and b) a pulse. I have been trying to write this for a while, but the morphine and lack of juicy cheeseburgers (what has it been now, five weeks without real food?) have drained my energy and interfered with whatever prose prowess remains. Additionally, the intermittent micronaps that keep whisking me away midsentence are clearly not propelling my work forward as quickly as I would like. But they are, admittedly, a bit of trippy fun. The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way. This is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and says, \"Give me your palm.\" And, voila\u0300, a colorful gumball appears. (He knows I love all the flavors but white.)"}

The first Poke\u0301mon games our generation truly fell in love with were the Red and Blue versions for the Game Boy. In those games, upon reaching Cinnabar Island, players have to navigate their ways through the Poke\u0301mon Mansion, a burned mansion where a Poke\u0301mon researcher used to live. Poke\u0301mon Go is no stranger to placing Poke\u0301mon in specific habitats.

Three of the nine (Mr. Mime, Kangaskhan and Farfetch\u2019d) are only available outside the US. The other six (Ditto, Moltres, Articuno, Zapdos, Mew and Mewtwo) have not been located at all, which begs two questions: Are they even available? If so, where are they?

The house, located at 10919 Georgetown Pike, Great Falls, Va., went on the market in June 2012 for $3.5 million, but was taken off some six months later. It was re-listed this July for same price; then $250,000 was shaved off in August. Another $252,000 came off at the beginning of September. Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas, whose shoe-pooping incident is not the most colorful event in his past, left the D.C. area at the end of 2010. And, hey, if you do buy this big house, that extra $500,000 might come in handy. Arenas, now playing ball in China (working, fittingly, for the Shanghai Sharks), once said that feeding the sharks kept in the tanks costs some $5,000 per month.

In this collection of still lifes on Vice\u2019s Creators, photographer Ambera Wellmann whimsically plays with these emotions by creating a photo project best described as uncomfortable. There\u2019s something deeply troubling about these pictures, and while I can\u2019t exactly put my thumb on it, the collection constitutes a great example of creativity in young photographers today. 1. \"Never-Before-Seen Photos Behind the Scenes at the Women\u2019s March\" \u2014 Washington Post 6. \"These Extremely Uncomfortable Photographs Are Guaranteed to Make You Squirm\" \u2014 Vice 8. \"Women Photograph: War, Weddings and Nightclub Queues\" \u2014 The Guardian \u2014Anna Mendoza, photo editor, BuzzFeed Australia 2. \"Honest Photos of Motherhood Challenge What We Think of as Natural\" \u2014 Huffington Post \u2014Kate Bubacz, senior photo editor, BuzzFeed News This portraits series is beautiful, and the faces only begin to hint at the poignancy of the subject\u2019s stories.

While the exact long-term impact of the Women\u2019s March in January remains to be seen, the event introduced ideas of what modern-day feminism looks like, in terms of scale, coverage and inclusivity. Kisha Bari\u2019s images feel instantly iconic, and will undoubtedly be added to the catalog of feminist history for being one of the few photographers to cover the making of such a large-scale protest. 5. \"8 Portraits of Refugees That Will Help You Understand the Refugee Experience\" \u2014 BuzzFeed News This feature showcases the undeniably extensive ways in which female photographers have made an impact. If industry awards were to paint the picture, women seem to make up only a small portion of photojournalism.

{"pred": "Nine families raised children who all went on to extraordinary success. Here\u2019s what they have in common Thousands of extraordinary families flourish across America, and the new generation of hyperaware parents may raise thousands more. But none of the parents in this story set out to raise successful children. Instead, the six commonalities of our nine families combined to create drive, grit and social consciousness that propelled all the siblings on their own chosen paths. Super Families: Secrets of Raising Successful Children The three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the U.S. In selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like Venus and Serena Williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the Trumps or the Kennedys). We looked for families in which all the siblings did well. And we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. Of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead. Of course, developmental experts have now proved Esther right: the first few years of a child\u2019s life are among the most important for learning and brain development. And between Stan\u2019s academic universe and Esther\u2019s educational parenting, another commonality emerges: seven of the nine families had a parent who was a teacher. But other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. Of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. Many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. Most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. Many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. And most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did. Some of the consistencies are fairly predictable. While none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. They had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. They weren\u2019t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. They didn\u2019t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids. In addition to Puerto Rico and India, the parents of these extraordinary siblings arrived from Israel, Haiti, Poland and China. For their children, the standards were unstated yet fundamental, as invisible and necessary as oxygen. Few of the siblings in this story had parents who closely monitored their movements, and many said they were raised with significantly more freedom than their friends. By the standards of today\u2019s helicopter parents, they ran wild. The Dungey sisters rode all over Sacramento on their bikes alone. The Antonoffs were allowed to skip school whenever they wanted. Six-year-old Zeke Emanuel regularly escorted 4-year-old Rahm home from nursery school on a Chicago city bus. a free-range childhood Political activism was a common theme for the parents in these families. Many of them were outspoken in their demands for reform in cities, schools and housing complexes, and never just for the benefit of their own children. While none of the parents held high political office, their involvement ranged from demonstrating for civil rights to union organizing to demanding that cities build new parks or that universities treat low-wage workers fairly. When they weren\u2019t pushing for reform, they were mediating heated political debates at home. Each of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. But we set out to find the ways they are the same. This is a story about nine American families with children, like the Rodriguez kids, who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields. The Emanuel brothers conquered medicine, politics and Hollywood. The Wojcicki sisters became scientists, CEOs and tech entrepreneurs. The Simmons brothers are a painter, a rapper and a media mogul; the Antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer. The Srinivasans include a judge, a public-health official and an entrepreneur, and the Gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges. The Dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive. One Lin sibling designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; the other has written 12 books. Like many of the other siblings in this story, Tan and Maya Lin grew up on a university campus, were raised by immigrant parents and bickered constantly over board games. They were also allowed to do practically anything they wanted. You could say it was the opposite of helicopter parenting. For some of these siblings, growing up in a constant state of trial-by-\u00adcombat made them tougher. For others, the bad behavior was a symptom of their willingness to make mistakes, an anti-\u00adperfectionism that hardened into resilience. It wasn\u2019t just that they fought; it was that they fought and then moved on. \"We were called a lot of bad names, and we had to withstand that and continue to go on,\" says Zeke Emanuel. \"That breeds a certain kind of toughness.\" The Simmons brothers grew up closer to raw, systemic violence than most families in this story. But even outside Hollis, some of the families (especially those with boys) recalled a household dynamic that resembled a fight club. With a few notable exceptions, most described a sibling dynamic that was wildly competitive at best and physically violent at worst. They grew up in controlled chaos: heavy on conflict, light on manners and indifferent to standards of appropriate behavior. For the Srinivasans, having a parent who was an educator created an unspoken expectation of academic achievement that was almost as powerful as familial love. \"You probably have somewhere in the back of your mind that you don\u2019t want to disappoint your teachers in the same way you don\u2019t want to disappoint your parents,\" says Sri. \"There was just no other way to think.\" The Gay Family Not all taught at the university level, though three families had at least one professor as a parent. The nine families also included parents who were elementary-school teachers, a preschool painting instructor, a doctor who taught medical students, a former French teacher and a school administrator who taught a night course on black history. Parent-Teachers It may be that the job itself was less important than the educational mind-set. Parents in these families instinctively under\u00adstood the importance of at-home instruction decades before researchers established the merits of early education. Their children recalled early supplementary lessons, books read aloud, regular \u00adlibrary trips and even at-home worksheets to give them an early boost in school. Esther had begun her daughters\u2019 ed\u00aducation long before they were peppering Stanford physicists with questions about nuclear particles. After working as a teacher and playground supervisor in the 1960s, she began to suspect that early-childhood education was more crucial than anyone then thought. \"My theory was that the most important years were 0 to 5,\" she says. \"It was a gut feeling. So I made everything into a game.\" She did arts and crafts projects with her toddler daughters, took them to the library every week and taught them how to read, count and swim before they even set foot in a classroom. The Simmons Family The Dungey Family The Gay siblings, a Haitian-American trio, grew up in Nebraska. Roxane Gay is a best-selling author and New York Times opinion writer, Joel Gay is one of the youngest black CEOs ever to helm a publicly traded company (Energy Recovery), and Michael Gay Jr. is a civil engineer. Their upbringing was stricter than their friends\u2019: the kids weren\u2019t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s home unless their mother Nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys. None of that was up for discussion. \"Parenting is not a democracy,\" Nicole says. Just like their neighbors, the three Srinivasan children\u2014Sri, Srija and \u00adSrinija\u2014played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes. But they didn\u2019t have chores in the same way their friends did. In the Srinivasan household, less was required\u2014but more was expected. But Esther has a theory. \"The more you do for your kids, the less they do for themselves, and the less empowered they feel,\" she says. Between their mother\u2019s civil rights work, their pediatrician father\u2019s campaign against lead paint and their grandfather\u2019s union loyalties, the three rowdy youngsters couldn\u2019t escape political awareness even if they tried. \"If we did not go with her to a particular protest, that protest was brought home,\" Rahm recalls, sitting in the briefing room of the Chicago mayor\u2019s office. \"Just eating dinner was a test of current events.\" (The brothers also have a much younger, adopted sister, Shoshana.) The Emanuel Family The Lin Family The Rodriguez Family They committed all the venial sins of American teenagers, and some of the cardinal ones as well. Across the nine families, there were incidents of teenage parenthood, smoking pot, underage drinking, cutting school, bar fights, shoplifting and drag racing. At least two had parties when their parents weren\u2019t home. Esther Wojcicki says she found out about her daughters\u2019 secret house party only when a student came to school wearing clothes pilfered from her own closet. (Her daughters dispute that particular anecdote.) Few recalled major rifts between their parents. But many of these siblings said they regularly fought with their brothers and sisters over everything from clothing to board games to who had to sit in the middle seat on long car trips. Zeke Emanuel puts it this way: \"If there wasn\u2019t blood, it was a good night.\" Their father didn\u2019t try to shield his sons from all violence. \"He respected what you learned in the culture in the street,\" says Russell. \"So he never really hid us from the stuff that was right on our corner.\" That exposure also created motivation. \"Seeing tragedy always pushes you to move past it,\" says Danny, the oldest, who beat heroin addiction decades ago. Esther Wojcicki taught her daughters to swim as soon as they could walk, specifically so that she wouldn\u2019t have to watch them when they played near the backyard pool. \"I empowered them early, because I wanted to make sure they could take care of themselves,\" she says. \"They could read early, so they could read signs. They could do math early, so they could handle money.\" Awareness of the im\u00admigrant experience, compounded by the fact that the Gays were often the only black family on their block, led to tough rules and high standards. \"Success and performance was not a choice. That was an expectation,\" Michael Gay Sr. says. \"Good grades in school, that was not something to make a big fit about.\" No one received a gold star from \"General Gay and his attache\u0301, Nicole,\" as Joel calls them. We talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, Jews from Chicago and Indians from Kansas and Haitians from Nebraska. We talked to siblings together and alone, and we talked to parents where we could. Here are six striking qualities they shared. Their father Henry Huan Lin had been forced to take calligraphy classes while growing up in China, an experience he loathed so much that it informed his parenting philosophy. \"He promised that when he had kids, they would never have to do anything they didn\u2019t want to do,\" Maya says. Posttraumatic growth is a tricky concept. For many kids and even adults, a loss of this magnitude may cause permanent devastation, not motivation. And yet while the Antonoffs experienced a loss significantly more shattering than most, many of the other eight families also experienced a brush with untimely death. The woman who was shot in the head in front of the Rodriguezes\u2019 home was their cousin. The Simmons brothers saw friends and neighbors killed by drugs, AIDS and gang violence. Rahm Emanuel nearly died as a teenager when a deep cut in his finger developed into a bone infection. (He ended up losing half his finger.) The Antonoff Family Left and Right: Courtesy of the Dungey Family \"The core was, We\u2019ve had a sick kid, we\u2019ve had a kid who\u2019s died, so let\u2019s get real about what\u2019s important here,\" Shira says. \"You\u2019ve got to find a path in life that you\u2019re really happy with.\" It can also help a family get their priorities straight. Jack and Rachel\u2019s mother Shira Antonoff said Sarah\u2019s death drowned out all the petty judgments and expectations of their suburban New Jersey community. She let her kids skip school, she didn\u2019t insist they finish college, and she took Jack to get his lip pierced at age 15, to the shock and dismay of other mothers in the grocery store. Susan is now the CEO of YouTube, Janet is a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the Uni\u00adversity of California, San Francisco, and Anne is a co-founder and the CEO of genetics company 23andMe. When they show up for breakfast in their childhood home on Stanford\u2019s campus, each wears a shirt that belongs to one of the others. (\"I just buy three of everything,\" says Anne, universally acknowledged as the best shopper of the bunch.) They immediately start mocking Anne for bringing her own kale to breakfast, mimicking Janet\u2019s high school cheerleading routine (Anne knows it by heart) and passing around a video of Anne dancing in a hula skirt on a family vacation. \"When you have three girls together, it was already a party,\" Janet says. And though few openly admit it, sibling rivalry can motivate achievement, says New York University psychologist Ben Dattner: \"Winning the Nobel Prize is a more civilized way of beating the crap out of your brother.\" Jack and Rachel Antonoff can\u2019t describe their childhood without discussing the third Antonoff: their younger sister Sarah, who died of a brain tumor when she was 13. Not all days were great\u2014the family moved from the rat-infested apartment only after a woman was murdered in front of their home. But the three daughters of Puerto Rican parents were kept safe, spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed. They learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook. They bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quincean\u0303eras. Such experiences can fuel ambition. After spending weeks in the hospital battling that life-threatening infection, Rahm says, he transformed from a slacker student into a go-getter. \"I made sure that given how close I came to dying, that I was never, ever going to not get the most out of everything I was doing,\" he says. \"I was a changed person.\" The Srinivasan Family The Wojcicki Family The Lin siblings spent most of their time outside, or writing poems, or throwing clay in the university ceramics studio. They went to a high school with an open-module system, which meant that sometimes they went to class only two days a week. \"I\u2019ve only ever chafed when there are rules,\" Maya says. Growing up surrounded by their dad\u2019s physics buddies had its drawbacks. On their school vacations, the girls were usually dragged to physics conferences, where they would torment the world-\u00adfamous scientists. They threw paper airplanes during presentations, hurled small objects off hotel balconies and even came up with an elaborate fashion-consulting prank to trick academics into changing their ugly ties. Another thing the Simmons brothers had in common with the Emanuels: they knew how to throw a punch. Growing up in heroin-ridden Hollis, Queens, in the 1970s, Danny and Russell once survived a street fight against 12 other guys. Occasionally, they\u2019d bring the fighting home. \"One time Danny took a comb and ran it through my hair, and it hurt real bad,\" says the youngest brother, Joseph, known as Rev Run. \"I think he was high.\" Even by the comparatively lax stan\u00addards of the 1970s, the Wojcicki girls had more freedom than most. Five-year-old Susan was often left to babysit 4-year-old Janet and infant Anne, and local mothers raised their eyebrows when the girls rode their bikes alone to the dime store a mile away. Left and Right: Courtesy of the Rodriguez Family \"We made a conscious decision that we are different enough, so we should do everything we can to make [the kids] feel part of their community,\" Saroja recalls. That meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras, watching the Kansas Jayhawks in a living room adorned with Indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate \"Krishmas,\" their version of Christmas. Left and Right: Courtesy of the Lin Family Left: Courtesy of the Antonoff Family; Right: Amy Lombard And so the Lin parents, who fled Mao and ultimately became professors at Ohio University, didn\u2019t monitor their children\u2019s homework or force them to join sports teams or push them to learn the piano. \"We were given all sorts of freedom to do whatever we wanted,\" recalls Tan, now a poet and the author of a dozen books. Maya, an artist and architect who designed the Vietnam Veterans \u00adMemorial, puts it this way: \"They were the anti\u2013dragon parents.\" Left and Right: Courtesy of the Srinivasan Family This clearly helped the Dungey sisters. ABC Entertainment Group president Channing Dungey is the first black president of a major television network, and her sister Merrin Dungey is a well-known actor, with major roles on Once Upon a Time and Alias. (She will appear on Conviction this fall.) Their mother had been an elementary-school teacher before Channing was born, and she applied her classroom skills to raising her two daughters in Sacramento. \"She would draw lines of faces, like three happy faces and one sad face, three triangles and one square, and then there\u2019s my little crayon marks marking the one that was wrong,\" recalls Channing, who learned to read when she was 2 years old. \"We never went to preschool, because we didn\u2019t have to,\" Merrin adds. Some of the rowdy behavior sounds like normal, run-of-the-mill mischief. Roxane and Joel Gay pushed their baby brother Michael down the stairs in a laundry basket. Susan and Janet Wojcicki loved to trick a young Anne into approaching strangers and calling them \"fat.\" Gina Rodriguez once put glue in her sister Rebecca\u2019s milk. The girls slept \"hot-dog style,\" cocooned in tightly wrapped sheets to keep out the vermin. They occasionally woke up during their father\u2019s nightly pep talks, rolled their eyes and then went back to sleep. But each morning, they did a series of jumping jacks, looked in the mirror and said, \"Today is going to be a great day. I can and I will.\" Being from Haiti in particular meant that there was a distinct honor to uphold. \"They were very proud of our history, that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere,\" says Roxane. Adds Joel: \"The more impoverished the country from whence you come, the more emboldened one\u2019s work ethic is.\" He says his parents, and the awareness of their sacrifice, created \"an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself.\" \"She was a supporter of us, but she didn\u2019t tell us what to do, and she allowed us to play and develop our own ideas,\" says Zeke of his mother. \"She didn\u2019t even worry too much whether they were safe or not.\" LESSONS IN MORTALITY Jack is a Grammy-winning musician who is the lead singer of Bleachers and lead guitarist of fun., now on hiatus. Rachel is a New York City\u2013based fashion de\u00adsigner. They\u2019re unlike many of the other eight families: their parents aren\u2019t immigrants or educators, nobody in their family cared much about politics, and they didn\u2019t break rules, because there weren\u2019t any rules to break. Instead, since their sister\u2019s death more than a decade ago, the Antonoffs say they\u2019re motivated by a constant awareness of their own mortality. There was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. \"It was more like, \u2018Look around. What\u2019s Mom doing? Does she need help?\u2019\" recalls Srinija, the youngest. \"Put things away. Pay attention.\" And one by one, they proved their father right: they could and they did. Ivelisse Rodriguez Simon graduated from Harvard Business School and is now a partner at a private-equity firm. Rebecca Rodriguez is the medical director of one of the best family-health clinics in the country. And Gina Rodriguez won a Best Actress Golden Globe for her starring role on Jane the Virgin. Not all kids from tough neighbor\u00adhoods make it out. But Russell is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings and the chairman and CEO of Rush Communications. Danny is a painter and author who co-created Def Poetry Jam on HBO with Russell and oversees the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation.

{"pred": "He was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he\u2019s proactively tackling homelessness. Work program gives homeless dignity, hope Republican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job. Anything Helps.\" The program hasn\u2019t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that\u2019s not really the point. It\u2019s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. And it\u2019s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life. Throughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city\u2019s poorest residents told him they didn\u2019t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn\u2019t know where else to go. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin\u2019s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city\u2019s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin\u2019s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city\u2019s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. Dozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It\u2019s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party. Next month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque\u2019s There\u2019s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed. Panhandlers are hired to beautify the city. (City of Albuquerque Mayor\u2019s Office) Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city\u2019s successful \"There\u2019s a Better Way\" program, which hires panhandlers to work in maintenance jobs and also aims to connect them with services. Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city\u2019s successful \"There\u2019s a Better Way\" program. (Albuquerque Mayor's Office) Berry\u2019s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A Berry\u2019s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas. There is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout. Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them. Tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin\u2019s the day after taking one of the city\u2019s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID. \"Genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are,\" Tillerson said. \"Many have medical conditions, they don\u2019t have the proper identification \u2014 you can\u2019t get a job without one. They don\u2019t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don\u2019t assume they are lazy.\" \"It\u2019s helping hundreds of people,\" Berry said, \"and our city is more beautiful than ever.\" The There\u2019s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That\u2019s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin\u2019s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs. But that\u2019s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it\u2019s the only option. When they\u2019ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years. \"You can just see the spiral they\u2019ve been on to end up on the corner. Sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it\u2019s remarkable,\" Berry said in an interview. \"They\u2019ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today.\" \"He now has a support system he didn\u2019t know he needed and definitely didn\u2019t know existed,\" she said. \"It\u2019s life-changing for them. He was one that said, \u2018I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.\u2019 \" In less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment."}
{"pred": "Heroin Hits Home: The Deadly Drug Invades America's Schools What Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. And it regularly is\u2014on varsity sports teams, on Ivy League campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods. In 2008 Duncan and his NCADA staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. \"It wasn't just that we were getting calls about heroin\u2014we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically,\" he says. \"It became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. Public, private, most of them.\" By 2010, the year Andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. \"The thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses,\" says St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch. \"Historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. But now the average age is between eighteen and 25.\" When Andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. According to Dan Duncan, associate executive director at St. Louis's National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (NCADA), most heroin users start with pain pills as Andrew did. It's no wonder: In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, National Institute on Drug Abuse director Dr. Nora Volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. But pain pills are expensive\u2014legally and on the black market\u2014pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin. Never even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson. For some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. At fourteen, Emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. By fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. Despite her habit, Emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. \"It was like I was leading a double life,\" she says. \"I thought, Maybe this is my little secret, and it's not as bad as everyone says it is.\" In 2012 and 2013, local news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin. Cases like Andrew's are becoming more of the norm, while those of recovering addicts like Emily seem to be more of the exception. And with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt, Emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her. She speaks at schools and treatment centers and is studying to become a nurse. \"Today I can be a part of things instead of apart from them. It's so hard to describe the pain and the misery I felt, the downward spiral,\" Emily says. \"My worst day in sobriety is so much better than even my best day getting high.\" Andrew went to his parents for help. \"He couldn't get away from the drug,\" says his mom, Pam. \"It's a hunger, it's a thirst. You throw all your morals out the window.\" Before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. After a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. Like Cory Monteith, Andrew was doing his best to clean up\u2014and everyone in his life believed he could do it. Until the overdose that killed him. Emily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. Doing heroin became part of her daily routine. When a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, Emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore\u2014it was something other kids at her school were doing too. During his sophomore year of college, Andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. Soon after that, he broke his hand. Add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and Andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. He became addicted. \"He would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could,\" remembers his friend, 26-year-old Missouri native Katie Gerstenkorn. \"He stole painkillers from me, actually.\" Over the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. Emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. She returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. Finally a switch flipped. \"I was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that I needed to go to any length to get sober. I had to change every single thing in my life, which was terrifying,\" Emily says. \"But when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change, that's when I knew I really had to do something.\" \"What have I become?\" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. \"What's happened to me?\" A star high school athlete who went on to play Division I football for Missouri State University, Andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. He was also a heroin addict. At first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend's older brother. He would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. Eventually she caved. \"I slept with him because I felt like he was giving something to me, so I had to give something to him,\" she admits. \"Looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that's why I was doing all these things.\" Her supplier was 30 years old. *Name has been changed.

{"pred": "Attach the soaked piece of bread to the foot with some plastic wrap to make sure it doesn\u2019t leak, and then cover with a sock. Wrap Your Feet In Bread And Saran Wrap To Naturally Remove Yucky Corns And Calluses Slice off a piece of lemon peel the width of the toe with the corn on it. Half a slice of stale bread soaked in apple cider vinegar is a great way to get rid of a callus that takes up a large area, like across the heel or ball of your foot. It can also make you self-conscious if you\u2019re walking around barefoot or in shoes that leave your feet mostly exposed. Like the lemon peel, a piece of onion soaked for about a day in white vinegar, secured to the foot and left on overnight, also breaks down corns. Like a callus, corns form where the skin regularly rubs against something, like where the knuckles of your toes run against the top of your shoes. Press it pith-side down on the corn and secure with a bandage. Keep everything in place with a clean cotton sock and wear overnight. Just like the lemon peel, the vinegar-soaked onion piece should be attached with a bandage, covered with a sock, and left on overnight. This remedy can be done during the day and worn under socks and shoes as you go about your business. It\u2019s also great for corns on small, hard-to-bandage places. Most people have calluses on their hands and feet caused by walking, holding a pen, or other activity. Do this every night until the corn disappears. But it also means that you might become more aware of the less cute aspects of your feet... Leave the paste on for at least 10 minutes, then rub the corn or callus with a pumice stone, and it should come off. In a bowl or basin of hot, soapy water, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and soak your feet. A corn is actually a type of callus. It\u2019s a round bump of hard, dead skin and is usually found on the thin skin of your body, like the tops of your fingers and toes. Rub the contents of a capsule on a corn before going to bed, then cover with a clean cotton sock. Rub the paste generously onto a corn or callus, and wrap with a bandage to hold in place. After years of wear and tear, being stuffed in shoes, and holding up your whole self, everyone\u2019s feet develop rough patches and bumps. This is normal and natural, but it\u2019s not always pleasant. And of course, this isn\u2019t just for feet, so if you have corns or calluses elsewhere, like on your hands, you can try these remedies there, too. It also means painting your nails cute colors, feeling the grass beneath your soles, and enjoying the cool breeze on your toes. Unlike a callus, corns are often painful due to being a hard, ball-like shape that digs in, rather than a broader surface. Repeat every night until the corn is gone. Calluses might be unsightly, but they\u2019re typically harmless and painless. And since there\u2019s a lot of evidence that shows going barefoot is really good for your overall health, you\u2019ll definitely want to show off your tootsies this summer. Remedy #5: Bread And Apple Cider Vinegar Take a non-medicated corn pad and place around the corn. Dab a few drops of castor oil onto the corn, and then cover with some adhesive tape to keep everything in place. Read on to learn how to make your feet summer-ready, and then break out some nail polish and wiggle your toes! But if you have corns, calluses, or other rough, hard skin on your feet? Never fear. There are simple, inexpensive, and all-natural ways to smooth your feet and get them soft and ready to show off, and you can do them all right at home. While calluses typically only look unpleasant and feel rough to the touch, corns \u2014 which are hard, rounded types of calluses \u2014 can be painful when pressure is applied, such as when walking or wearing a shoe. If you\u2019re wearing socks, wear old ones in case the oil leaks. Summertime means sandals \u2014 at least, when you absolutely have to wear shoes at all!  But be forewarned that the smell will be much stronger! This will soften calluses enough to file down with a pumice stone. For corns, rub a dab of castor oil on each one after each soak. A word about filing down calluses: Be gentle. It will take longer, but rubbing hard with a pumice stone will actually just make the callus worse. What Are Corns? Crush about five uncoated aspirin tablets into powder, and mix with equal parts apple cider vinegar and water to form a paste. Do this daily, and your feet will be soft and smooth in about 10 days. What Is A Callus? A callus is a thick, tough area of skin that forms in response to repeated and regular friction or pressure. Your body builds up a callus to protect your skin. Remedy #6: Castor Oil Rubbing the oil inside a vitamin E or vitamin A capsule is a great treatment for corns. So, if you have issues with corns and calluses, what can you do? Remedy #7: Aspirin Remedy #3: Lemon Peel While they\u2019re meant to be taken internally, you can also topically use the gel inside of vitamin capsules by breaking them open and squeezing a bit out. Remedy #1: Apple Cider Vinegar And Castor Oil The callus will be softened and ready to file, or gone completely by morning. Remedy #4: Onion And White Vinegar Remedy #2: Vitamin E Or Vitamin A"}
{"pred": "\"That said, the traffic has to go somewhere,\" she said. Although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, Waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, Mossler said. They have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, officials have begun working directly with Waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data. Waze\u2019s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, Mossler said, not to create traffic jams. Waze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to user's destinations. Here's what you need to know about the app. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) In California, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs. In the Los Angeles region, Waze\u2019s biggest U.S. market, a City Council person representing Sherman Oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small residential streets from their algorithms. It was here that Connor learned that some Waze warriors had launched concerted campaigns to fool the app. Neighbors filed false reports of blockages, sometimes with multiple users reporting the same issue to boost their credibility. But Waze was way ahead of them. Waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver. Average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app\u2019s cartoonish interface. When the first Waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow. \"It used to be that only locals knew all the cut-through routes, but Google Maps and Waze are letting everyone know,\" said Bates Mattison, a city councilman in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven, Ga. \"In some extreme cases, we have to address it to preserve the sanctity of a residential neighborhood.\" Soon after, Connor went rogue. He experimented with Waze, confirmed it was sending drivers down his street and began filing his false reports. The marked detour around a months-long road repair was several blocks away. But plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past Connor\u2019s Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps. It\u2019s not possible to fool the system for long, according to Waze officials. For one thing, the system knows if you\u2019re not actually in motion. More important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers. And so Connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of Southern California and other traffic-weary regions: He became a Waze impostor. Every rush hour, he went on the Google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow. But still they came. One afternoon, Connor counted a vehicle every two seconds on a street with a single lane available between parked cars. One morning, neighbors awoke to a cacophony of honks and went out to find a backup dozens of cars deep, two drivers in the middle about to come to blows. When population growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby Interstate 85. In response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections. [Three workers once died rebuilding this bridge. Now a new makeover is under way.] \"I could see them looking down at their phones,\" said Connor, a water engineer at a federal agency. \"We had traffic jams, people were honking. It was pretty harrowing.\" In Portland, Ore., for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a \"greenway\" bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic. It worked. Those who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it\u2019s happening at Internet speed. The cut-through disputes \"are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic,\" said Paul Silberman, a traffic engineer with Sabra, Wang & Associates in Columbia, Md. The traffic flow began to wane when the road construction ended, Connor said, but remains three or four times higher than before it began. For some drivers, their app-inspired shortcut became a permanent route. Tim Connor stands by a sign his neighbor purchased to thwart commuters from cutting through their quiet residential street in Takoma Park, Md. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post) Connor and his neighbors put up \"No Through Traffic\" signs. And their city councilman, Tim Male, tried to get Google Maps to take note of the official detour, by calling the company and flagging it through the apps\u2019 feedback feature. \"The nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it\u2019s not there,\" said Julie Mossler, Waze\u2019s head of communications. The company will suspend users they suspect of \"tampering with the map,\" she said. \"The apps reacted pretty quickly to that,\" said Jonathan Maus, publisher of Bikeportland.org. When the traffic on Timothy Connor\u2019s quiet Maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, \"Continue on Elm Avenue . . . .\" [A warning left on a nanny\u2019s car. License plates stolen. And a Pentagon official in big trouble] The apps didn\u2019t create the traffic, Mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn\u2019t have known about otherwise. \"It didn\u2019t do much and within two weeks they stopped showing up on the map all together,\" Connor said. \"They were on to me.\" Traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow. He continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks.

{"pred": "According to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health. Plain seltzer or sparkling water\u2019s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. But check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives. Colas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel. Seltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters. Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It\u2019s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that\u2019s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,\" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale). Bottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water. An additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. The amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure, and current sodium levels among most Americans are already considered too high. 2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages."}

Things went boom, cars got clobbered. This is especially clear in the Jason Bourne trailer when a SWAT truck driven by Vincent Cassel (known only as The Asset) rolls through Vegas and cars going after Damon's Bourne. We had to ask producer Frank Marshall just how many cars were destroyed in the screen madness. One noble vehicle survivor was The Asset's SWAT truck, which ended up rolling right through the Riviera Hotel & Casino. Marshall pointed out that the building was set to be destroyed anyways (officially it was taken down in June). So Jason Bourne and that truck just helped the cause. Matt Damon talks about destroying the Las Vegas Strip in his new movie 'Jason Bourne.' USA TODAY The Bourne spy franchise has filmed chases in Paris, Moscow and Tangier. LAS VEGAS \u2014 What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Unless it's full-on car-destruction-mayhem from the Jason Bourne shoot. Producer Frank Marshall attends the Las Vegas premiere of 'Jason Bourne.' And how did he know that number so quickly? \"I counted, I had to pay the bills,\" said Marshall, adding that these were just the destroyed cars from the scene. \"They are all in a trash heap somewhere.\" \"But we have never shut down a main thorough-fare,\" said Marshall. \"I feel it\u2019s our best chase yet.

With a little more reluctance, Marshall did cop that this was close to a half-a-million in car costs alone \u2014 provided by manufacturers, but modified for the scene. Damon would watch the stunts from his hotel room late into the night, even facing an early morning call the next day for work. \"We would shoot all day.

It was like, 'I know it\u2019s time to go to bed, I have to get up at 6 a.m. But I just want to see this.' \" It made for great watching even shooting the stunts which are almost entirely practical (VFX was used to erase safety elements and camera platforms). \"It took out the marquee, went right into the lobby. But the SWAT truck survived pretty well. That thing was built to last,\" he said. \"I have always wanted to take a building that was going to be demolished and use that in the movie,\" Marshall said. \"So we helped destroy the Riviera.\" Surprisingly the custom-built SWAT truck was okay, allowing Marshall to marvel.

{"pred": "How This 27-Year-Old Made $1 Million Last Year And last year, she made just shy of $1 million   $979,000, to be exact. In 2015, her earnings jumped to $321,000. In 2013, excluding her salary from her full-time job, which she quit that year, she earned $117,000. Since then, she has increased her income each year. Here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly. She got a job as a financial analyst earning $50,000 a year (plus bonuses of about $12,500 annually), but she set a goal of paying off her debt within six months. In 2014, that increased to $164,000. Though it took her one extra month, paying off a huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over-achievement. Plus, the 27-year-old is a digital nomad. She and her husband live in an RV, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in Arizona when we spoke in late January) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including Colorado National Monument, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Arches, Moab, and others. I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000. It also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says. How much did you earn from the blog to begin with? How has all this newfound wealth changed you? Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016? How exactly does the blog bring in money? Her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports. My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills. In the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month. My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them. I started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money. In December 2012, when Michelle Schroeder-Gardner graduated with an MBA, she had $38,000 in student loan debt. How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood?  But the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive. The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done. Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform. How has your wealth changed your relationships? How has your changing income changed your lifestyle? What were your expenses during this time? What do you do with your extra income?  As soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it. Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of the Making Sense of Cents blog and her husband, Wesley Gardner (Courtesy of Michelle Schroeder-Gardner) How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's? Until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me. I had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs. I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income. By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%. So in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things. How did you pay off your student loans so quickly? As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time. It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth. I've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems. Six months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later. I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long. When did the blog start coming into the picture? We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon. Growing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm. My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms. How big is the RV? Why did you start living in an RV? It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money. My advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course. The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever. My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was. I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it. Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week. In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others. How much time do you spend on your blog? But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since. Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums. How big was your house?  Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff? I also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community. For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible. We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms. We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long. It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out. I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it. Do you have help?"}

Here at The Huffington Post we spend a lot of time coming up with ways to waste less food, spend less money on groceries and eat better meals.

This ensures that the consumer will purchase the older product first, before it spoils and they have to throw it out. It's a simple concept, but an effective one. Here's what you need to do with that information: use this method at home. Start today and see the difference. It really is that simple. Photo credit: Almay"}

{"pred": "To honor the centenary of his birth this month, the Oxford English Dictionary has updated its latest edition today (Sept. 12) with six new words connected to Dahl\u2019s writing, and revisions to six other phrases popularized by Dahl\u2019s evocative stories. In May, the Oxford University Press also published a Roald Dahl Dictionary complete with 8,000 words coined or popularized by the author. Scrumdiddlyumptious to Oompa Loompa: Six of Roald Dahl\u2019s splendiferous words have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary Roald Dahl is remembered for his solitary, kind-hearted child heroes\u2014Charlie, who visited a chocolate factory, and Sophie, who befriended a floppy-eared giant, among them\u2014and their triumphs over bullying adults. But the beloved British children\u2019s book author was also known for the distinctive language he used to create the vivid, often dark, worlds in which the characters lived. Here are the new Dahlisms added to the OED, and the revised phrases, with notes on their origins. There was linguistic method to Dahl\u2019s mad use of language. \"He was using very linguistic principles,\" says Vineeta Gupta, head of children\u2019s dictionaries at Oxford University Press. Dahl invented words based on old words, rhymes, malapropisms, and spoonerisms (swapping the first letters of words around, such as \"catasterous disastrophe\" from The BFG). Dahl also played with sound (\"sizzle-pan\" to refer to a frying pan in The BFG, for example). Dahlesque The characteristics of Dahl\u2019s work\u2014in the OED\u2019s words, \"eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and gruesome or black humour\"\u2014now have their own adjective. The term was first used in 1983 by the literary magazine Books Ireland. Oompa Loompa The diminutive factory workers who played music and danced in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were made more famous by the 1971 film adaption of the book, starring Gene Wilder. Gupta called the phrase \"typical Dahlesque,\" reflecting how the author played with sound to convey meaning. (esp. of food) delicious.\" Although the word was first found in The American Thesaurus of Slang in 1942, Dahl\u2019s giant\u2019s use of it planted it firmly in the minds of every child who read The BFG: \"Every human bean is diddly and different. Some is scrumdiddlyumptious and some is uckyslush.\" Witching hour Referred to in The BFG as \"a special moment in the middle of the night when every child and every grown-up was in a deep deep sleep, and all the dark things came out from hiding and had the world to themselves.\" We can thank Shakespeare for this evocative phrase: according to the OED, \"witching time\" first appeared in Hamlet (1604). Golden ticket These refer to the tickets hidden in chocolate bars that granted access to Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964). The first golden ticket, however, was awarded to 18th century painter William Hogarth, giving him admission to the Vauxhall Gardens in London, in recognition of his paintings of the venue. Human bean This is a mispronunciation of \"human being,\" uttered by the giant in The BFG (1982): \"We is having an interesting babblement about the taste of the human bean. The human bean is not a vegetable.\" The first instance of the phrase is over a century older, having been used in an issue of the British satirical magazine Punch in 1842.

{"pred": "The best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen. Making Olive Oil in the Peloponnese Being Greek, I grew up eating olive oil. I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece. Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country. Concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words \"traffic jam\" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. Needless to say, I greatly enjoy the small villages of the Peloponnese. So when George Papageorgiou, the owner of Esti Olive Oil, asked me if I wanted to go to Kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, I jumped at the chance. To me this was kind of like winning the lottery. I was going to the Peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some \"liquid gold.\" We took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. \"This,\" he explained \"is the traditional method used for making olive oil.\" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of \"extra virgin\" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of \"extra virgin\" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects. The Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are \"just right.\" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It's a constant balancing act. In Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition. The final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled. As we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia."}

Colorado Springs, the state's second largest city, voted to ban recreational pot shops last July and became the largest community in the state to opt-out of the state's new marijuana laws. KRDO first reported about local marijuana advocate Tim Klob's petition where he helped gather nearly 600 signatures to put a measure on the November ballot to allow recreational marijuana sales and industrial hemp grows in the southeastern Colorado town of La Junta. Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 last November making the limited sale, possession and growing of marijuana for recreational purposes legal for adults 21 and over. A64 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot, can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home (with only three flowering at any given time), but that home-grown marijuana can only be for personal use and cannot be sold, however, adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot. Unfortunately for Klob and for the citizens supporting the measure, the petition effort failed because Klob inadvertently violated Colorado law when he didn't staple each petition volunteer's affidavit with the signatures they collected when he turned the documents in to the La Junta city clerk's office. Though all necessary materials were included in the documents, the lack of staples voided the petition through a technicality. A64 allows adults to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for recreational use even in those cities or counties that have banned retail sales. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed several historic measures to implement marijuana legalization in the state, establishing Colorado as the world's first legal, regulated and taxed marijuana market for adults back in May. The United States government took a historic step back from its long-running drug war last week, when Attorney General Eric Holder informed the governors of Washington and Colorado that the Department of Justice would allow the states to create a regime that would regulate and implement the ballot initiatives that legalized the use of marijuana for adults. Klob and La Junta are now back to square one. \"I see this as a game changer for our economy,\" Klob said to KRDO. \"There\u2019s no other industry knocking on our door right now.\" Watch KRDO's interview with Klob here."}

'Star Wars' Actress Daisy Ridley Fires Back at Body Shamers Daisy Ridley: 5 Things to Know About 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Star One symptom the \"Star Wars\" actress experienced was bad skin, which left her feeling self conscious especially being in the public eye. \"Feeling so self conscious has left my confidence in tatters. I hate wearing makeup but I currently don't want to leave the house without it on,\" she wrote in the Instagram caption. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" star, Daisy Ridley, revealed a powerful message on her Instagram Thursday. The actress, 24, posted a selfie and explained that she has been suffering from endometriosis since she was 15. Ridley has found that with the help of dermatologists and diet changes, like cutting out dairy and most sugar, she is finally making progress and finding relief. \"My point is, to any of you who are suffering with anything, go to a doctor; pay for a specialist; get your hormones tested, get allergy testing; keep on top of how your body is feeling and don't worry about sounding like a hypochondriac,\" she wrote. \"From your head to the tips of your toes we only have one body, let us all make sure ours our working in tip top condition, and take help if it's needed.\" Endometriosis occurs in women of child bearing age and can be hard to diagnose. Ridley said she was also diagnosed with Polycystic ovary syndrome after 8 years of tests. Parenting expert Denise Albert reports on some ideas to help care for children who are home sick from school. \"One laparoscopy, many consultations and 8 years down the line, pain was back (more mild this time!) and my skin was THE WORST.

{"pred": "Take two areas where you\u2019d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund. I hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic. I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America\u2019s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president. So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he\u2019ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she\u2019s dishonest. The risk is that he\u2019ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct. But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task. Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September. If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\" But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?\u2019 Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America\u2019s highest office \u2013 but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win. So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she\u2019s all that stands between you and an American nightmare. The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida. Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She\u2019s been advised that she mustn\u2019t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary\u2019s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about. So low are expectations for his performance on Monday \u2013 where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him \u2013 that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton\u2019s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle. This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others\u2019 donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting \u2013 of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides. You don\u2019t have to love her. You don\u2019t even have to like her. You\u2019re not saying she\u2019s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, \"Don\u2019t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative.\" And the alternative is President Trump. If that sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a show we\u2019ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV. You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don\u2019t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven\u2019t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents\u2019 history of failure.) This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency \u2013 and no Iraq war."}

{"pred": "The secret reason Apple might be killing the iPhone 7 headphone jack Maybe I'm reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that Apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year \u2014 a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign \u2014 in order to protect the next iPhone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack's removal. Regardless of what other whiz-bang goodness Apple introduces this year \u2014 and I'm sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate \u2014 the reality is that this will absolutely be the iPhone remembered as \"the one where Apple dropped the headphone jack.\" Waterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see. And these would be amazing upgrades \u2014 old design or not \u2014 but the real headline is that this is the first iPhone without a headphone jack. And now, I guess we can add, \"it won't have a headphone jack.\" I feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iPhone will be minimal. People will grumble. Adapters will be annoying and we'll all bitch and moan about how Bluetooth just isn't good enough. But we'll survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either Lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options. We'll have moved on. Which of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iPhone will be all positive. New design, new screen and some other snazzy feature. But that missing headphone jack? So last year's problem. Let's all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack. Yes, yes, I've been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since January . A frequent point of discussion on our podcast, MashTalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality. Even Tech Editor Pete Pachal has come around to see the light. The jack is dead. Despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, I'm still going to buy the iPhone 7. But I mostly just want to get this release over with so I can start looking forward to the iPhone 8. So, I suspect, does Apple. And that's why, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the iPhone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iPhone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iPhone doesn't carry that particular scarlet letter. Bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of Apple reporter Mark Gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iPhone over the next few months. The big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iPhone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button. Oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? It's dead. Dunzo \ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port. Still, I'm sure I'm not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iPhone and says, \"Huh. OK.\" Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone in a few weeks. And, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iPhone 7 Downplaying the iPhone 7 so the NEXT iPhone can thrive \ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 If we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen. It will be Apple's fastest iPhone ever. And there will be backlash. The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when Apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original iMac. And thinking about it, I have to wonder: Is Apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year's iPhone \u2014 you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp AMOLED screen \u2014 won't suffer? That's the phone that might ditch the home button altogether. It's also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. In case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iPhone: Not to downplay the new stuff (though I have thoughts on that, just wait), it's worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iPhone predictions to a tee. This isn't to say I won't still buy the next iPhone \u2014 I'm TOTALLY going to buy the new iPhone in September \u2014 but if we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen. I can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact. It will have Apple's most advanced optics. There will be at least one extra feature you can't get on any other iPhone. And Apple loves to celebrate anniversaries. Personally, I think that's OK. I'm not completely sure how I feel about Apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three \u2014 new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that you've got the latest and greatest phone \u2014 but now that we're nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year. \ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 A 20th Anniversary Edition Macintosh from 1997.

{"pred": "That was more than two years ago \u2013 a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male \u2013 yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students.  The 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Only two parents objected, Boerke said. Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and Principal Thomas Aberli says there have been no problems.  Although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease.  Opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it\u2019s an issue of safety for non-transgender students. In March, Springfield Central High School in Massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. Principal Thaddeus Tokarz said transgender students aren\u2019t required to use it, though some choose to do so. The school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February. Students can still choose what works best for them. Although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, Biggs said a student visited him in November and explained that some transgender students didn\u2019t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available.  Some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment. Despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, Aberli said that hasn\u2019t happened at Atherton. At least once a day, Pam Retzlaff answered a call from parents concerned about her decision to allow a transgender student at Edgar Road Elementary School to use a bathroom different from his biological gender. In reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety.  In response, Boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another.  In a Virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school\u2019s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity.  Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month\u2019s deadly mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students. Last month, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Justice Department told schools across the country that Title IX of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities. Hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school\u2019s existing bathrooms. He\u2019d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment. \"I believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with,\" Tokarz said. \"We have several transgender students now,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just kind of a non-issue.\" According to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network\u2019s 2013 School Climate Survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did. It was new territory for Retzlaff, then principal of the school in Webster Groves, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn\u2019t open the bathroom. Student Alonzo Hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the Santee Education Complex, a high school in Los Angeles, where he is a junior.  Four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. About half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted. Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York-based organization that supports LGBT-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do. In Texas, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has demanded the resignation of Kent Scribner, Fort Worth\u2019s school superintendent, over the district\u2019s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. Patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it \"social engineering.\" This month, the Kansas Board of Education voted unanimously to oppose the Obama administration\u2019s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students. In Camas, Wash., across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., Liberty Middle School Principal Marilyn Boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, \"but it just didn\u2019t happen.\"  But ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan. \"There were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he\u2019s a pedophile,\" Lara said. And students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change. \"There\u2019d be times when I would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so I could come out of the stall,\" he said in an interview. The majority of students surveyed said they didn\u2019t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse. they\u2019re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential,\" Biggs said. \"We wanted to make that possible.\"  The concerns weren\u2019t unfounded. Jose Lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the Los Angeles school\u2019s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest. The department reminded schools that those that did not comply with Title IX requirements risked losing federal funds.  \"The students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change,\" Lara said. \"Those little things make a huge difference in a student\u2019s day But the backlash is only beginning elsewhere. \"This was probably the best decision we made as a school all year,\" said Kevin Biggs, principal of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa. \"If they were listening to local authorities,\" she said, \"they\u2019d get out of the way.\" \"Part of that could be how our community at Liberty is really all about family,\" she said. \"We just don\u2019t accept that kind of intolerance.\" According to FBI statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias. Texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the Obama administration\u2019s policy.  \"It was hard in the beginning, very hard,\" she said. \"You can imagine my first open house.

{"pred": "To try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits. Trump\u2019s Public Policy, Explained The reality is that Trump\u2014like policymakers and politicians past, present and future\u2014is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility. This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window. When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had \"a better chance of cameoing in another \u2018Home Alone\u2019 movie with Macaulay Culkin\u2014or playing in the NBA Finals\u2014than winning the Republican nomination.\" With a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to FiveThirtyEight and \"exactly zero\" chance of winning, according to The Atlantic, how has Trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 Republican hopefuls? Using the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage This wasn\u2019t just a flip-flop or mere pandering \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that Trump\u2019s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA\u2014which endorsed him\u2014said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\" With this in mind, now consider Trump\u2019s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons. The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It\u2019s So True... For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window. It is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters. The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us \u2014 you, me and our neighbors \u2014 who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change\u2014if you want to expand the Overton Window\u2014appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow."}
{"pred": "We recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before Wednesday. In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both. The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun\u2019s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it\u2019s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts. What about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners? Yes, you\u2019ve read correctly. Every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an \"assault\" is now strictly illegal. In the face of utter inaction by Congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence. If Washington won\u2019t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will. Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so. What does the state consider an \"assault weapon\"? \"Assault weapon\", shall have the same meaning as a semiautomatic assault weapon as defined in the federal Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. section 921(a)(30) as appearing in such section on September 13, 1994, and shall include, but not be limited to, any of the weapons, or copies or duplicates of the weapons, of any caliber, known as: (i) Avtomat Kalashnikov (AK) (all models); (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil; (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70); (iv) Colt AR-15; (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR and FNC; (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9 and M-12; (vi) Steyr AUG; (vii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and (viii) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as, or similar to, the Street Sweeper and Striker 12; provided, however, that the term assault weapon shall not include: (i) any of the weapons, or replicas or duplicates of such weapons, specified in appendix A to 18 U.S.C. section 922 as appearing in such appendix on September 13, 1994, as such weapons were manufactured on October 1, 1993; (ii) any weapon that is operated by manual bolt, pump, lever or slide action; (iii) any weapon that has been rendered permanently inoperable or otherwise rendered permanently unable to be designated a semiautomatic assault weapon; (iv) any weapon that was manufactured prior to the year 1899; (v) any weapon that is an antique or relic, theatrical prop or other weapon that is not capable of firing a projectile and which is not intended for use as a functional weapon and cannot be readily modified through a combination of available parts into an operable assault weapon; (vi) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition; or (vii) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than five rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine. Wait\u2013to get the guns off the street? I thought she\u2019d just said it was legal to own them if you\u2019d bought them before Wednesday. Now she\u2019s got a moral obligation to get them \"off our streets.\" Right. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests\u2013they\u2019re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation. I could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but I wouldn\u2019t want to let the wind out of the AG\u2019s sail. Well, we all knew it was coming. You can\u2019t have a \"mass shooting\" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding Americans. And this time it is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She published this in The Boston Globe today. If I were in Massachusetts, I\u2019d be feeling a bit paranoid right now.

{"pred": "UFC Fighter Valentina Shevchenko was today involved in an armed robbery shootout in Chorrillos, Peru yesterday. Shevchenko is scheduled to fight former UFC bantamweight champion Holly Holm on July 23 at UFC ON FOX 20. Given both women have extensive backgrounds in boxing and kickboxing, expect this fight to be full of striking and excitement. Reports have confirmed that Shevchenko\u2019s coach, Pavel Fedotov, was armed with a gun and decided to take matters into his own hands. Firing at the group of men, Fedotov allegedly killed one of the men. Shevchenko was at a restaurant, Campero\u2019s Chicken Grill, with her coach Pavel Fedotov, when a group of men stormed the place. The men demanded that any money on the premises be handed over, as well as personal belongings that the customers had on their person. Should Shevchenko pull of a huge win against Holly Holm, she would leap into UFC title contendership almost instantly. Former champion, Holm, lost her UFC bantamweight title to Miesha Tate earlier this year at UFC 196. Holm won the UFC title in November at UFC 193, where she stunned the world by beating the formerly undefeated, Ronda Rousey. Despite being relatively unknown in the MMA scene, Schevchenko\u2019s resume is jam packed with success. She has won gold at the IFMA World Championships nine times in the last 13 years. Video footage of the incident shows Shevchenko running to Fedotov\u2019s side to check he is okay. It\u2019s currently unclear what his condition is. Fedotov is a muay thai veteran, who won gold last weekend at the World Muay Thai Championships in Sweden. He is also married to Shevchenko\u2019s sister, Antonina. She holds an impressive 58-2 kickboxing record and a 12-2 mixed martial arts record. Her last fight was at UFC 196 where she lost to the now number one contender, Amanda Nunes. He was then shot himself in the stomach, where he was rushed to hospital for treatment. The area is relatively known for high crime, in fact this was the fifth time that Campero\u2019s Chicken Grill has been robbed. It is believed that the men were extremely violent, beating people who refused to hand their personal belongings over. Footage of the incident can be seen here."}

Liquid makeup, such as concealer and foundation, should be replaced every six months, Franzino said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate cosmetics, but does warn consumers that \"a cosmetic product may go bad if it is stored improperly \u2014 for example, in a place that is too warm or too moist.\" \"You should not be using it beyond that expiration date, especially sunscreens,\" Franzino said. \"It's hard to keep track of every single thing that you have so before you go to use any product just take a second and think, 'Okay, have I had this for a really long time?'\" Liquid makeup that is used around the eyes, such as eyeliner and mascara, should be replaced every three months, Franzino added. \"Good Morning America\" teamed up with lifestyle expert April Franzino, the beauty director at Good Housekeeping magazine, to find out how long you can keep day-to-day products such as makeup and shampoo. Products with active ingredients, however, such as toothpaste, are regulated by the FDA, meaning they will have an exact expiration date that experts advise you should probably stick to. Franzino's tips to save money on beauty products include swapping out liquid eyeliner in favor of a longer-lasting pencil and buying products that have pumps instead of traditional lids because they prevent bacteria from getting in. As far as hair products go, Franzino advised that shampoo and conditioner are generally good for a year. Aerosol spray products can last much longer. Franzino also recommended not to buy items with an expiration date in bulk because you may end up having to throw it away before you use it. \"That's where bacteria can grow,\" she told ABC News, \"so you really need to be careful about switching that out every three months at least.\" View photo \"At that point you may start to notice that they're not performing as well,\" Franzino told ABC News. \"So you might want to switch them out.\""}

{"pred": "'Bloodthirsty' Moroccan Ruler Really Could Have Fathered 1,000 Kids, Computer Simulation Shows According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismai\u0308l fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismai\u0308l was 57 and had ruled for 32 years. To solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismai\u0308l had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record. Sultan Moulay Ismai\u0308l of Morocco, \"The Bloodthirsty,\" reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000. Now computer simulations suggest this could have been possible if the ruler had sex about once a day for 32 years. The simulations suggest Ismai\u0308l needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring \u2014 the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women. Some researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismai\u0308l could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismai\u0308l had said. Although the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that Ismai\u0308l could have actually had all these children, \"the results from them were all quite different from each other,\" Oberzaucher said. \"This really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction \u2014 you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women.\" The simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. Other factors included how good Ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles. Ismai\u0308l's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismai\u0308l was infamously ruthless \u2014 his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle. Any suspicion of adultery against Ismai\u0308l was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death. \"We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,\" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science. Ismai\u0308l, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, was the first great sultan of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty, the current royal house of the kingdom. He was Sharifian \u2014 that is, he claimed descent from Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Oberzaucher and her colleague Karl Grammer detailed their findings Feb. 14 in the journal PLOS ONE."}

She's the California state director of the non-profit organization Drug Policy Alliance, \"the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights.\" Gillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving \"We\u2019re doing something that has never been done before, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail, so to speak, no pun intended,\" she explains. Not to mention, working to help victims of America\u2019s War On Drugs: \"We\u2019ve had 40 years of a failed drug war, our fathers, our brothers, our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations, and disproportional rates for minority populations, and as women, we shouldn\u2019t stand for that anymore.\" She says the favorite part of her work is without a doubt assisting patients, from veterans whose PTSD is diminished with treatment, to elderly patients who now live happier and healthier without chronic pain, to women who are no longer feeling stuck without options to address their reproductive concerns. \"Women have always been healers throughout history and this (female) plant represents what I personally consider the fastest moving area of science and medicine,\" says Peters. \"We need women to help bring cannabis medicine to the next level for the sake of patients everywhere.\"' \"I\u2019ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana,\" says Gillette. \"So in 2010, when I saw the state of Colorado was going to be regulating, being the first state in the nation to do so, I decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly-formed business enterprises.\" At the time, Gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients. However, Gillette\u2019s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry. Along with working to fund cannabis research, Lyman\u2019s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana-advocacy communities more inclusive, especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society. an attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010. Her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance, tax law for marijuana businesses, and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of Colorado. Lyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses, that doesn't mean they're the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place. \"One thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it\u2019s been men\u2019s faces at the forefront and yet it\u2019s been a lot of women doing the behind-the-scenes work,\" explains Lyman. \"I\u2019m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry. You have to find a way to expand and let other people in. That\u2019s a policy priority for DPA.\" Greene adds that she didn\u2019t quit her job as a reporter because she hated it, but because she knew there was work to be done in marijuana advocacy: \"There was a community of people that needed someone to be bold and I knew that was me. So I\u2019m gonna continue what I\u2019m doing, just on my own terms with The Weed Show.\" You may remember Charlo Greene from when she went viral for quitting her job as a reporter on like television while outing herself as the founder of Alaska Cannabis Club. Now living in Los Angeles, Greene says, \"I\u2019m Charlo \"Fuck it, I quit\" Greene, and I\u2019m credited with the legalization of marijuana in Alaska.\" An exceptional entrepreneur, she\u2019s also behind NewCannabisTimes.com and the founder of Go Greene, a cannabis diversity summit series. 4.

Greene\u2019s success has come with a heavy price that proves the War on Drugs in far from over. \"I\u2019m facing 54 years for creating the Alaska Cannabis Club, so in the meantime, it\u2019s dreary that my life could be over this year,\" she explains. \"But if I stop doing what I know I am here to do, which is share these amazing stories and activate people, then the state has already won.\" Her next court appearance is January 11, and she\u2019s assembled a top-notch legal team and is feeling hopeful, yet knows both America and the weed industry still have insurmountable work to do. \"It will be interesting when they try to drag up club members that literally credit the [Alaska Cannabis Club] for saving their lives. I think the state of Alaska will be on trial just as much as they\u2019re putting me on trial.\" \"You\u2019re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they\u2019re with some cannabis association, whereas five years ago even, people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary,\" Lyman explains. \"The advice I give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history. There\u2019s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it\u2019s just any other industry. I want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died, people have been incarcerated, they\u2019ve had their families destroyed. Making sure you\u2019re a good neighbor, and you\u2019re working with the community that you are based in.\" Dr. Lakisha Jenkins has a doctorate in naturopathy, is a member of the American Herbalist Guild, and is a master herbalist, and founding board member of the California Cannabis Industry Association. Beyond helping write the legalization laws that just passed in the state of California, Dr. Jenkins can take 500 varieties of herbs and marry them with cannabis to treat whatever ails you. If you love pot and natural medicine, she\u2019s someone you want to know. 1. Dr. Lakisha Jenkins, Master Herbalist Her advice to women and other minorities looking to break through? \"Be fearless and strong in your conviction. Know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don\u2019t let anything get in your way. Surround yourself with other like-minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself, because education is going to be what\u2019s going to help you persevere. Because people are going to challenge you all the time. But if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience, and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command, you\u2019ll be taken seriously.\" \"I use my connections to pull in as many community leaders of color to come in and share their knowledge, experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry, and make it mean something for them and their communities,\" says Greene. \"I think a lot of the work that I\u2019m doing is overlooked because I am a woman and because I am a person of color.\" 2. Rachel K. Gillette, Attorney 5. Jessica Peters, President of Moxie Meds \"My family is from the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians, so we have Native American lineage and my grandfather is a native healer,\" she explains. \"I just went back to my native roots and just researched.\" Along with her work as a healer, Dr. Jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege. \"There\u2019s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country, you don\u2019t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you\u2019re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry,\" explains Dr. Jenkins, who has also been a part of the Minority Business Council for three years. \"We add organic basil extract (which contains beta-caryophyllene) and lab grade, U.S. made, naturally extracted beta-caryophyllene (BCP) as well. We also add organic strawberry extract for flavor balancing - doesn't taste overwhelmingly like strawberry, it just balances out the plant and BCP flavor profile,\" explains Peters. Unfortunately, despite the abundance of healing Dr. Jenkins gives back to the world, she went through great loss to get where she is today. \"My oldest daughter Kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old, and I questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her,\" explains Dr. Jenkins. \"I was informed that the State of California knows what\u2019s better for my daughter than I do and that if I did anything different than conventional treatment, then I\u2019d be acting outside of medical advice and that I would be a threat to her. Unfortunately, I was forced to accept, but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation, I started researching and studying for my doctorate, and figuring out other holistic alternatives.\" \"We always say November 8th wasn\u2019t the end, it was the beginning,\" she explains. \"That\u2019s true with most laws Kiona passed away in January 2006, 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday. Dr. Jenkins now practices in her honor, going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques. often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that\u2019s the most important piece, because if you pass a law and it doesn\u2019t get implemented, then it\u2019s as if it didn\u2019t pass.\""}
{"pred": "An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions. The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago! Sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: The levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. The reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed \u2013 including the enigma of the \"missing uranium.\" The first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started. Source: Naturally Occurring Nuclear Fission The conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows. That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident. It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions. The nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. The neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. Then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. This watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years. One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium. The second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction. Unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened. Featured Image: Danilo Russo/Flickr"}
{"pred": "Digital Immortality: How Technology Will Bring Loved Ones Back to Life Currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die. The theory that humans will eventually be able to upload our brains to computers has fascinated futurists and neuroscientists for years. By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist. Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones.) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead. Beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones. The Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their \"most important thoughts, stories, and memories\" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents. While the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy \u2014 edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory \u2014 experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved. Digital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death. Both Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave. These services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves. They let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data \u2014 the texts and tweets and \"Likes\" and photos \u2014 and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were. \"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way? If people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back? She imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone. AfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave. Meanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to \"life.\" Until we can really can upload our brains to the cloud, that's our best shot at immortality. \"The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time \u2014 it may take years,\" Ursache says. \"A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don't have this time. This forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives \u2014 preservation first, technology second.\" \"We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,\" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. \"We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.\" \"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\" Heather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one. Long-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too. \"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Eugenia Kudya created an AI-powered chatbot in honor of her friend Roman Mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. Kudya and other mourners could \"speak\" with Roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions \u2014 its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence. The natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy. But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could. Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you. \"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\" The goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\" Since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today. Though Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet. Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public. While the Roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that Eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend."}

Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women. However, incidence rates are now converging among white and African-American women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years. \"Although the incidence haven't declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate. Death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990. However, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival,\" Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay . Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, while African-American women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group. In June, a JAMA study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found. Authors of of the ACS report also noted that reproductive history and obesity are more strongly linked to ER-positive breast cancer, the form of the disease more common among white women, while lower socioeconomic status has been linked to raised risk for ER-negative breast cancer, which is more common among African Americans."}

Nick Johnson is the first person to announce he has collected every Poke\u0301mon in the popular mobile game Poke\u0301mon Go. That is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of North America. \u200bUsing GPS and augmented reality, the game developed by Niantic Labs invites players to catch the colorful Poke\u0301mon monsters best known from Nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s.

Mr. Mime , Farfetch'd and Kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in Europe, Asia and Australiasia, respectively. However, it is rumored these Pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in North America that users can pick up at PokeStops.

At least for now until he takes his international Poke\u0301mon catching trip. Pokemon trainers flocked from around the Bay Area to attend San Francisco's Pokemon Go Crawl where they met fellow trainers and talked Pokemon over discounted themed drinks. Johnson said that he had a couple of nights, when he got around the 135 Poke\u0301mon mark, that kept him out till 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. This trainer's solution: heavy doses of black tea in the morning. \"I\u2019ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100's of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in North America) as far as I know,\" Johnson said. \"That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one,\" Johnson said. \"I was close to the end so it was extra motivation.\" \"I probably wouldn\u2019t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn't got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City,\" Johnson said. Marriott Rewards has offered to sponsor Johnson to go to Europe, Japan and Australia to catch the regionally based Poke\u0301mon and finish his collection, he told USA TODAY Friday. A Marriott spokesman confirmed the trip. Even so, he said he doesn't feel like the game affected his professional life, stating that Poke\u0301mon Go is a gaming platform and he works for a platform innovation company, so he felt like the game translated back into the work he did everyday. He's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model. He said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. Beside growing up playing the Poke\u0301mon games, of course. Secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good. If she decided to leave before him, he said she would give him her phone to help her collect more monsters and he usually found himself heading home around 12 a.m. or 1 p.m., the normal time he goes to sleep.

{"pred": "The U.S. government grows some seriously garbage weed for research Not only is the weed bad, but Sisley claims it was moldy as well. So the government clearly doesn't have it together when it comes to growing pot. Though it's relatively simple to grow, the quality of cannabis you can purchase (legally or illegally) in the United States can vary greatly. Lighting, air quality, humidity and pests can all play a massive role in the end product, so growing weed may be pretty easy, but growing great weed can be pretty taxing.  Government marijuana looks nothing like the real stuff. See for yourself. https://t.co/UKNSYwqPWQ pic.twitter.com/IbQv8p5NWu According to reports from PBS and the Washington Post, all marijuana used in research must be supplied by the federal government, and the pot that the government has been handing out looks like trash.  'It doesn\u2019t resemble cannabis. It doesn\u2019t smell like cannabis.' In the age of stickiest-of-ickiest-and-rising THC percentages, it appears the United States government still supplies researchers with low grade brick weed you probably smoked in high school. Actually, it's worse than the weed you smoked in high school.  As the Post points out, when researchers are testing the effects of marijuana, they need to test the real thing that people are actually growing, buying and consuming. But the cannabis being supplied to researchers currently is far from something you'd typically buy in a dispensary in Denver. Or getting from an illegal delivery service in New York City.  Though there way may be hope on the horizon: The DEA announced in the summer that it would start to allow other bulk growers the ability to provide cannabis for medical research, though none have yet been approved.  And while weed comes in plenty of colors, shapes, densities and sizes, the pot analyzed by PBS and the Post looks extremely yellow and filled with stems. \"It doesn\u2019t resemble cannabis. It doesn\u2019t smell like cannabis,\" she said. While it was determined the mold variety in the cannabis was not harmful to adults, it's clear that the United States needs to form better quality control and standards testing for cannabis, be it medical, recreational or for research. Regardless of how you feel about marijuana, the effects of the plant deserve to be properly researched, and right now, it appears they aren't.  All of the cannabis provided for medical research comes from a 12-acre farm located at the University of Mississippi. The farm is run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and is the only facility licensed by the DEA to grow pot for research, since marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug to the DEA. (It's classified in a category with heroin and ecstasy, which also makes a lot of sense.) Sue Sisley, a researcher with MAPS studying the medical effects of marijuana on U.S. veterans suffering from PTSD told PBS the weed supplied to them for the study doesn't even smell like weed. Shockingly, 13 percent THC is the highest percentage NIDA offers. In Colorado you can walk into a dispensary and buy weed that is easily 20 percent, sometimes upwards of 30 percent.  NIDA blamed the mold problem on the lab, saying they didn't handle it properly when they left it in a refrigerator for two days instead of freezing it. MAPS fired back, saying the weed with elevated total yeast and mold counts \"were found in samples that never left the freezer before testing,\" according to PBS. Sisely had the samples provided by the government tested by an independent lab in Colorado as a part of typical protocol. There they found high levels of total yeast and mold in some samples, as well as potency that didn't match what they had ordered. One sample was supposed to contain 13 percent THC \u2014 it reportedly had just 8 percent.  Rick Doblin, MAPS\u2019 director, blasted NIDA's capabilities by telling PBS, \"They\u2019re in no way capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities for handling a drug that we\u2019re hoping to be approved by the FDA as prescription medicine. \" When confronted about the mold and potency, NIDA and the University of Mississippi told PBS that neither test the samples for mold before they're shipped. \u2014 Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 13, 2017"}
{"pred": "\"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt will moderate the first presidential debate Monday. (Photo by Jose Luis Villegas/the Sacramento Bee via AP) Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News\" will moderate Monday's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Previous moderators have advised this year's questioners to be as invisible as possible, but scrutiny is inevitable. Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992 Holt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president. He moderated a Democratic primary debate Holt got to practice his moderating skills at a Democratic debate in January, though he split questioning duties that night with Andrea Mitchell. Dominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning. Before the lights go on, here are five things to know about Holt: Donald Trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators. He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode. Holt is a registered Republican He was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked Clinton about the \"reset button\" with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state. Time magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make. These are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Lester Holt Sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of California State University, Sacramento, to work at a San Francisco radio station. But he wasn\u2019t as worried as his wife, June. \"She predicted poverty and failure,\" he said with a laugh. But the Rancho Cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that Lester Jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism. Holt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV's nightly newscast: \"Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.\" \"Lester is a Democrat,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly last week. \"It\u2019s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It\u2019s a very unfair system.\" \"We are journalists first,\" Carter said. \"That's a huge distinction. We're not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.\" In general, however, it is not unusual for Holt to go several days or even a week between tweets. His relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to Trump's obsession. Conspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be. Holt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. He was fairly active while in Rio de Janeiro during NBC's coverage of the Olympics, sharing images like these: Joining on stage for some Brazilian Jazz in Rio tonight. #BoyFromIpanema pic.twitter.com/xJ5MoYGtPZ \u2014 Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 13, 2016 Things worked out okay. Since dropping out, Holt has received honorary doctorates from Cal State Sacramento and Pepperdine University. Apparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. \"Meet the Press\" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University. (He told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) The late ABC anchor Peter Jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school. Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree \"They're hitting Matt Lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're \u2014 they're trying to game the system,\" Trump told Fox News last weekend. \"They want \u2014 and this, I think, is terrible \u2014 they want the hosts to go after Trump.

{"pred": "The One Thing Not to Say to Someone With OCD Here's why: It's insensitive to diminish OCD to the one, slightly obsessive or compulsive behavior you have. It shows a serious lack of understanding of what OCD is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying \"Oh, we all have that! It's not that big of a deal.\" I'm happy to explain this to you, to answer any and all questions -- anyone who knows me knows I'm not exactly a shy or private person. But please, take this route instead of attempting to relate in a way that, unless you actually have diagnosed OCD, you would never be able to. I know you don't mean to come off as both uneducated and insensitive, so please, don't respond as if you are. My OCD has affected me for as long as I can remember -- and although it's now managed well enough where it's not necessarily something people notice on their own (a proud accomplishment, if I do say so myself), there have been times it has been debilitating: severe anxiety; bleeding knuckles from obsessive washing; rapid weight drops from stress-related appetite loss; intricate and obscenely repetitive bedtime routines. Because even if color-coding your closet is an annoying habit -- and I'll give it to you, maybe even an \"obsession\" or \"compulsion\" -- your comment comparing this to actual, medically-diagnosed OCD comes off as an underhanded way of telling me that it's not only something that everyone has, but something that doesn't warrant psychiatric or therapeutic attention. For my disorder, it's a response that I would equate to saying that you understand someone's pain over the death of an parent because you once had a pet that died. Thanks for the effort, but no thanks for comparing my dead mother to your dead goldfish. Now, it's not always color-coding closets -- it could be anything from polishing silverware, to double-checking locks, to eating the same thing every day for breakfast. And yes, OCD symptoms present both in a variety of ways as well as varying degrees. But unless you are educated on the disorder, have seen a therapist, or have some sort of confirmation other than your own unfortunate desire to connect with me about this -- I'm going to be honest and let you know I really, really don't want to hear your superficial self-diagnosis. I get it -- knowing how to respond to someone's disorder or disease can be tough. I'm one of those people who gets uncomfortable extremely easily, so I have sympathy for people that look similarly awkward when it comes up that I have obsessive compulsive disorder. I also get the desire to not only sympathize, but to empathize by finding some way to relate to this very important, and often dominating, part of my life. Which is the only reason I can assume that I hear this (or some version of this) response so often: \"OMG same! I keep my closet perfectly color-coded!\" Now, I know this isn't your intention, and I try to keep this in mind as I grind my teeth and try to explain somehow, that no, that really is not the same thing. And don't get me wrong, I'm happy to explain it to you -- but I would much rather do so in response to a question or genuine interest, not a backhanded attempt at empathy."}
{"pred": "The Top 5 Free and Open Source Inventory Management Software Systems ... What other free inventory software solutions are out there? Let us know in the comments! Luckily, you don\u2019t have to go broke just keeping an eye on your product. Here are five free or open source inventory management offerings for small businesses. All of these systems can manage most small business inventory requirements, with many offering flexibility to move up as your company grows. Odoo may have the strongest position for an existing large company, but the low prices for its competitors mean that there are plenty of options within most budgets. Odoo is designed as an ERP, but thanks to the software\u2019s add-on app layout, you can make it as large or small as your business requires. For inventory management, you\u2019ll probably want to take advantage of at least the warehouse management system and perhaps the purchase or point of sales system as well. ABC Inventory is the child of Almyta Control System. It\u2019s a free package for a single user, allowing you to manage multiple warehouses, serial numbers, warranties, and a host of other inventory related data. This free version is really designed to be run on one computer, though, as multiple workstations can\u2019t sync the same data. Since it\u2019s an ERP, all of your data will be combined in the backend, so purchases can flow into inventory and into your accounting, as well. Odoo online can be a great open source answer for a small business, while larger businesses can get a lot out of the full featured software. Managing your inventory effectively can be the difference between making the sale and losing it to a competitor. If you don\u2019t know what you have or where it is, you\u2019re going to have a tough time selling it. inFlow is an inventory management software focused on small and medium businesses. The company has been growing since 2007 and now claims over 750,000 users. inFlow has a free option that limits you to 100 products and customers, and a baker\u2019s dozen reports. You also miss out on some advanced user features and inventory management options. Users can set automatic reorder reminders when stock gets low, can print labels for stock, and can integrate with a barcode system. If you need more than the ten products or want more users, growing businesses can upgrade to Rightcontol Solo, Pro, or Workgroup for about $1.50, $7.50, or $30 per month \u2014 the company\u2019s rates are given in British Pounds. Each comes with an increase in the number of products that can be managed. Rightcontrol Lite provides inventory management for ten product lines. It also comes with invoice and receipt generation tools, geared toward the small business or self-employed individual. Apart from a limitation on product lines, the Lite flavor offers all the features of its bigger sisters and brothers in the Rightcontrol line. The free version has no expiration, though, and small businesses will be well-served by the small set of options. Default features include barcoding, different accounting methods, and automatic data backup, among others. We\u2019ve talked about Odoo here before , but it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot to like. For two people using the online system, Odoo is free. If you download the open source version and host it yourself, Odoo can be free for everyone, though you\u2019ll have to support it yourself. Carta includes some interesting options for collaboration with buyers and sellers, so you can assist folks through the ordering process. With the background from inFlow, Carta should offer you everything a small business needs. Luckily, every level is currently free since Carta is still in its beta testing phase. You might have a few hiccups along the way, but you can get the $99 per month package for free, right now. The company anticipates the free betas running through the end of 2015, so you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out which package works for you. As with almost all free options, you\u2019ll be supplying the support \u2014 though there are some forums to give you a hand if things get tough. ABC is geared specifically toward smaller companies that don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles that come with a bigger system. Carta is the online offering from the people who brought you inFlow. Carta also offers a slimmed down free version. Carta\u2019s limitations are based on the number of sales per month that can be processed \u2014 at the free level, it\u2019s a mere 10. Once you outgrow the free version, inFlow can be upgraded for a one-off, $399 payment. That will unlock unlimited products and customers, more reports, and advanced features like customized invoices and order forms. Paying customers also get a year of support. Final thoughts"}

{"pred": "One thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today. But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk. As a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier. You can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the Scion xB. In the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. Why the big shift? This underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most US cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. You can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models \u2014 like the Buick LeSabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right): A few key technological developments made these designs possible \u2014 and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier. Reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the \"jelly mould\"), and the car did not sell well at first. Over time, though, buyers got used it \u2014 especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars. This aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports. And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, \"American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers.\" In Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers \u2014 especially in Germany \u2014 explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design. In the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors. One of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963: For decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. During the 1980s, they began using computer models. Ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era: By the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea \u2014 it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers. The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance. Sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback. But its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the '80s \u2014 and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 Ford Taurus. Part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed. Automakers had to improve fuel economy It turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes. It might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. The Taurus, writes Gartman, \"was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed.\" Look at a photo of a street scene from the '70s or early '80s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today. Most of the buildings are similar. People's clothes, on the whole, aren't all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads. Automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus. \"They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy,\" says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history. The strategy worked. The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company \u2014 and inspired a wave of copycat American cars. While automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. \"One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering 'under the hood,' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. increase for almost nothing,\" Gartman writes. \"It's much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood,\" Sparke says. \"They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves.\" Manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before. In the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack \u2014 who'd worked on the company's European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 \u2014 was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus: Technology made it easier to produce curves It all started with European luxury designs Right as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time. Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon.

Social says, explains, you should value what you know and start charging for it. As she explained in her autobiography #GirlBoss, the more time you spend saving, the more money you\u2019ll make. As Warren Buffet says: 'Only invest in companies that can be run by a monkey, because one day it probably will be. You can\u2019t do a good deal with a bad person.' 'Once it\u2019s in there, forget about it. You never saw it anyway. It\u2019s an emergency fund only (and vacations are not emergencies).' Invest wisely: Don\u2019t invest in anything unless you are prepared to put at least 10 per cent of your net worth into it: Some people invest in lots of little things with the belief that it might be a good investment, but when it comes down to it are not that sure. Avoid becoming a busy fool: It is very easy to become very busy doing things that are a huge drain on time but have little or no end value. For example, taking on too many projects that are unlikely to come to anything. If you are not confident enough to be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into it, then avoid it. So before investing a little into something, don\u2019t ask yourself can you afford to lose this small amount, ask if this is something you would actually be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into. She said: 'Treat your savings account like just another bill. It has to be paid every month, or there are consequences. If you have direct deposit, have a portion of your paycheck automatically diverted into a savings account. So, if you are skilled in a certain area, charge people for it - and they will actually be willing to pay."}
{"pred": "The good news is that a male venture capitalist thinks he has an innovative new solution to solve the gender gap in tech. The bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men. As a LinkedIn editor, I regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. Rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, I suggest they own it. In order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. To get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like Greathouse suggests. Heidi Roizen , an operating partner at DFJ, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. After becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, Roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. That way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn\u2019t know if they were male or female. The fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. In fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what Greathouse suggested. After having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year\u2019s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. Highlighting female voices was the conference\u2019s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority. In a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are. \"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It\u2019s wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if I put my head down and just work, I will get noticed... Success is competency, yes, but it\u2019s also personality and warmth.\" I sat down with Dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at TAP , a tech conference in New York. The topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. [Greathouse did not respond to an email I sent him requesting comment. In a tweet, he apologized for the column.] \"This is sad, but it is also true,\" said Roizen. \"Yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is.\" \"We know that companies that have diverse teams do better,\" said Susanne Greenfield , a Director at Priceline Group. \"But there is this unconscious bias. People want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. You have to do something to fight that bias.\" Nimi Katragadda , a principal at BoxGroup, agreed with Roizen that you can\u2019t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was \"asinine\u2019 advice. \"Why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?\" she said. \"You are making the problem worse that way.\""}

If you compressed the entire history of everything, going back to the Big Bang, into a calendar year, all of human history would only take up just a little more than the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year. 21. If the history of the universe were placed on a calendar year, humans would only exist starting around 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31. Since it takes about 50 milliseconds for visual information to process in your brain, by the time you actually \"see\" something, it happened in the past. 3. Oh, and the Stegosaurus was older to the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T. rex is to us. 4. The oldest living person was born closer to the signing of the US Constitution than to today. 22. More than 6% of all humans who have ever lived are alive today. 19. Pluto didn\u2019t even get to complete one orbit around the sun between the time it was discovered and the time it was declassified as a planet. 1. Cleopatra lived closer in time to the invention of Snapchat than to the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. 5. The 10th president of the United States has two grandchildren who are alive today. 20. 9/11 happened closer to the fall of the Berlin Wall than to today. 18. Some of the world\u2019s whales that are alive today were born before Moby-Dick was written. 17. Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., and Barbara Walters were all born in the same year. Thanks to a boom in population growth following advances in technology and medicine, the current human population living on Earth right now is about 6% of the entire human population in the entire history of the planet. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, only 12 years before 9/11, the 15th anniversary of which just passed this year. 2. Also, the Great Pyramid was older to the Romans than the Romans are to us. 8. We made it to the moon only 66 years after the Wright brothers invented human flight. 6. Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization. 10. When the first Star Wars movie came out, France was still executing people by guillotine. Not only did they not exist at the same time, but the T. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the Stegosaurus died out. 9. Woolly mammoths were still alive when the Great Pyramid at Giza was built. 13. Betty White is older than sliced bread. 11. When the fax machine was invented, people were still traveling the Oregon Trail. In fact, the pyramid was roughly 1,000 years old when the mammoths went extinct completely, which wasn\u2019t until about 1560 BCE. Some bowhead whales are believed to have a lifespan of more than 200 years. Since Moby Dick was published in 1851, that means there may be whales out there who are nearly 50 years older than the book. 15. If they made a That \u201990s Show and waited the same amount of time after the decade as That \u201970s Show waited after the \u201970s, the show would be made in 2017. 7. Harvard University was founded before Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity. Cleopatra died a little more than 2,000 years ago in 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed around 2560 BCE. That\u2019s a difference of more than 2,500 years. Um, so, Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. THE AZTECS. Though they\u2019re often thought of as having lived in very different times, Anne Frank, Barbara Walters, and MLK Jr. were all born in 1929. 14. Will Smith is now older than James Avery (Uncle Phil) was when Fresh Prince of Bel-Air started. 12. The Ottoman Empire still existed when Paramount Studios was founded. It might seem like That \u201970s Show was made way after the end of the \u201970s, but that gap is exactly the same as the gap between now and the \u201990s. Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, the oldest living person today at age 117, was born in 1899. That\u2019s 112 years after the signing of the Constitution, which was signed in 1787. Pluto was discovered thanks to an observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, back in 1930. It was heartbreakingly demoted in 2006. Because of its distance from the sun, Pluto takes 248 Earth-years to orbit the sun just once. That means it didn\u2019t even get halfway around during the time it was being called a planet. Not sure how it\u2019s even possible, but Will Smith is now 48 years old. James Avery was 45 when Fresh Prince premiered back in 1990. While not nearly as old as Oxford, Harvard is still an old university. It was founded in 1636, almost 50 years before Isaac Newton published his Principia Mathematica in 1687, which outlined his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. 16. The Eiffel Tower was inaugurated the same year Nintendo was founded. Speaking of 1922, that\u2019s the year Betty White was born. By contrast, the first commercially produced, automatically sliced loaves of bread weren\u2019t made until 1928. The Wright brothers\u2019 first flight was in 1903, and the Apollo 11 moon landing was in 1969. There\u2019s so much Americans can accomplish when we get in a pissing contest with Russia. The first major wagon train hit the Oregon Trail in 1841. Just two years later, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain created a preliminary version of the modern fax machine. Oxford began teaching in some form all the way back in the year 1096. By most accounts, the Aztecs didn\u2019t begin their civilization until the beginning of the 13th century. The Ottoman Empire was founded around the year 1300, but it lasted all the way until 1922. Paramount was founded 10 years earlier in 1912. Even in its earlier years, the Roman Empire was still further removed from the construction of the Great Pyramid than they are from us. John Tyler had a son, Lyon Tyler, at age 63. Lyon went on to have children late in life as well, including Lyon Tyler Jr. and Harrison Tyler, both of whom are alive today...and are only in their eighties. Most people know that the Eiffel Tower was inaugurated for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair. What you might not know is that Nintendo started out as a playing card company, and was founded in the same year. The final execution by guillotine in France occurred in 1977, when a man by the name of Hamida Djandoubi was executed for torturing and killing his girlfriend. That was the same year the first Star Wars movie hit theaters."}
{"pred": "Both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships \u2014 but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did. First, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men. Scores of psychological studies suggest that, for guys, attractiveness isn't just about the way you look. Perhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships. Unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationships than attractive men low in altruism. A growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: Men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who don't. In a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men. In a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships. Second, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. When it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men. About 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. Half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive. All the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship. More recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks. From being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women \u2014 especially if you're looking to land a long-term relationship. It could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there. The women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive. It's hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions. But they do suggest that, if you're a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldn't hesitate to flaunt the fact that you're an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week. Each pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. For example: \"two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe.\" One man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person. Some of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter. Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\" The researchers walked away with several key findings."}
{"pred": "Aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics. Protecting the world\u2019s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business. While these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India\u2019s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park. No one has easy answers. \"Rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances,\" Grig said. She added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime. \"I think this is something we need to be discussing,\" she said. At the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers. Finally, Peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. \"The just war theory,\" she said, \"lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?\" If we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. Similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons. Grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. \"If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,\" she said. \"If you shoot them dead, you can\u2019t ask them any questions.\" Annette Hu\u0308bschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the \"current militarized approach\" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. \"There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, \u2018follow the money\u2019 approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,\" she said. \"We\u2019re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. \"It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.\" One way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan\u2019s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. \"Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human\u2019s death rather than a dog\u2019s death,\" she said. Over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants. More broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. This ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. \"We have that debate here about Florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators,\" she said."}

{"pred": "How artificial intelligence could stop those awkward moments when your credit card is mistakenly declined Financial institutions have for years collected data on customers\u2019 habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised. That\u2019s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home. The system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision. It\u2019s an experience many shoppers have had: You\u2019re queued in line at the store prepared to make a purchase only to have your credit card declined for no apparent reason. A perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise. MasterCard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through. It\u2019s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience. MasterCard\u2019s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card. The system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent. Each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer\u2019s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change. The company called it \"the first use of AI being implemented on a global scale directly on the MasterCard network.\" But Visa, MasterCard and PayPal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said Celent analyst Arin Ray. While most in the industry think AI holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report Ray co-authored in August. Citing a survey from Javelin Advisory Services, MasterCard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the United States in 2014 \u2014 well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud. That\u2019s a large sum of money that retailers \u2014 and credit card purveyors like MasterCard \u2014 could be pocketing. Machine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level. For example, the system might detect that you haven\u2019t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often. Or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate. Digital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce. PayPal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands. \"There\u2019s a magnitude of difference \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated,\" PayPal\u2019s senior director of global risk and data sciences, Hui Wang, told American Banker. For the last decade, Visa has deployed its Visa Advanced Authorization system to detect fraud. The volume of data and the speed at which it\u2019s processed have increased considerably over that time, said Mark Nelsen, the company\u2019s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence. Visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases. \"We can look at that transaction and, knowing what we\u2019ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad,\" Nelsen said. \"What we\u2019re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence,\" Marlin said. \"For this to work we need all kinds of data coming in,\" said Ajay Bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at MasterCard. \"We\u2019ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network. \"We see this as a critical component of our future strategy,\" Bhalla added. \"We are embedding AI in everything we\u2019re looking at as a company.\" \"The old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules. With a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives,\" said Todd Marlin, a principal in Ernst & Young\u2019s forensic technology and discovery services practice. \"The concept of AI has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years. The volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it],\" Ray said in an interview. \"One [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations. Since it\u2019s still unproven technology, they don\u2019t want to take that risk if they have to make major changes to their existing infrastructure,\" he said."}

Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. Wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in September, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff. 7. Bicycles \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates bicycles expensive August is plenty warm enough to still enjoy outdoor cycling, so it\u2019s typically a bad month to invest in a new bicycle. If you can wait, prices start to drop closer to the fall, with discounts starting in August and lasting through December, according to Consumer Reports. Just like car dealerships, bike shops need to make room for the new inventory toward the end of the year. So the best time to look for a rock-bottom deal is during the winter months, according to Bicycling.com. The site also recommended avoiding models that are more than a few years old, even if they are deeply discounted. Advances in cycling technology change so quickly that a \"great deal\" might actually just be an average one if you can get a far superior model for just a little bit more money. 6. iPhones and iPads \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates iphones ipads expensive August is a terrible time to August is a terrible time to upgrade your Apple devices because the company usually unveils their upcoming models in September or October, reported DealNews. This means the price on an Apple device purchased in August will immediately begin to lose value in the coming weeks and months. If you\u2019re in the market for a new iPhone or iPad, either purchase it earlier in the summer or wait for deals on older models in the fall. 2. Back-to-School Supplies 1. Cold-Weather Clothing \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates cold weather clothing expensive In July, the cold-weather months seem far away, but as we get into August and to the back-to-school and holiday season, stores start to put out fall merchandise. This means the prices on items like warm coats, long pants, boots and sweaters will be at their highest during this month. You might find back-to-school sales on some of these items, but you won\u2019t find any deep discounts like you can during other months. A great way to save money on clothing all year is to shop during the off-season. For example, look for discounts on cold-weather clothing during the spring and early summer months, and purchase your summer gear during August and September, according to Consumer Reports. Another tip to shopping in the off-season is to always keep your receipts. The discounts on off-season clothing can increase quickly and dramatically, and stores like Target, Sears and Kmart have price-match policies for anywhere from 14 to 30 days after purchase. 4. Patio Furniture \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates patio furniture expensive The last full month of summer might seem like a good time to buy new patio furniture, but retailers usually wait until September to really drop prices on these goods, according to DealNews. August is still a warm month, and customers will pay full price to lounge outdoors and soak up the sun. Since you can easily spend $400 to $2,000 or more on an outdoor furniture set, according to HowMuchIsIt.org, it\u2019s smart to wait until then, as retailers will be trying to quickly sell off the remaining goods. Keep in mind that popular stores like Sears and Home Depot might sell out of discounted outdoor furniture more quickly than a small retailer, so keep your eye out for deals starting at the end of August, according to personal finance advice website SmartAsset. But if you buy before Labor Day, you\u2019ll likely pay more than you would later, according to CBS News. 5. Televisions \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates televisions expensive Deals on televisions are usually scarce during the summer months, and prices are still high on HDTVs in August. Prices do start to drop in the fall, as the summer comes to a close and the holiday season starts to ramp up. If you need to purchase a new TV before the prime season, DealNews recommended looking for a name-brand 55-inch TV or larger for around $500, although you might be able to save around $100 by going for an off-brand. Also, college students who want to upgrade the TVs or LCDs in their rooms should wait until school has been in session for at least a few weeks to score better prices. 3. Theme Park Tickets \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates theme park tickets expensive The summer season is an ideal time for a family to The summer season is an ideal time for a family to head to a popular theme park , but ticket prices are at their highest during these months. Typically, theme parks are the most crowded when kids are out of school, through late August, during the week of Thanksgiving, over the winter holidays and during spring break season. Because the demand is so high, these businesses charge the most they can for entrance to the park, according to Nasdaq.com. Not only does this put a major dent in your wallet, but it can also increase how much time you have to wait to go on a ride. So you\u2019re paying top-dollar to visit the park, but getting less value because you have to spend so much time waiting to see the attractions. Dave Shute, co-author of \"The Easy Guide to Your First Walt Disney World Visit\" recommended vising Disney World between the second week of Easter and the week before Memorial day, mid-to-late October, any week in November other than Thanksgiving, and during December up to a week before Christmas."}
{"pred": "Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men \u2014 especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men \u2014 are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference \u2014 affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so \u2014 but they can only go so far. The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don\u2019t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade. Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn\u2019t occurred. But that premium itself isn\u2019t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average). Notice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall. The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men \u2014 there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates \u2014 yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" \u2014 women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa \u2014 has slowed. There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn\u2019t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" \u2014 the relative decline in wages for women when they have children \u2014 has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too \u2014 something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal. Bailey and DiPrete\u2019s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have \u2014 and haven\u2019t \u2014 made over the past half-century. It isn\u2019t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality \u2014 explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure. Other measures of women\u2019s progress in the workforce \u2014 their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies \u2014 show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women. Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off. Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.) Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed\u2019s meeting hasn\u2019t resolved the question. Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn\u2019t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers. If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you\u2019d still be making about the same \u2014 a bit more than $22 per hour. Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress. The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May\u2019s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending \u2014 a key pillar of strength in recent months \u2014 is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed\u2019s task in two ways: Policymakers don\u2019t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates. The Fed But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error. The Olympic tax Number of the week"}

Jingee is a 12 year old cat who was found outside of the Toronto Human Society back in May. The shelter took him in and he's been looking for a forever home ever since.

{"pred": "Another Ann Coulter Rant About Hispanics 'Wrecking The Country' Ann Coulter can\u2019t stop raging against Hispanic voters. Coulter violated the embargo on the study, writing that it was \"too important to wait.\" The study was not provided in the column, so it\u2019s not clear what new information it contained. Coulter writes that the study brings together several different previously released surveys by Pew, Gallup, Latino Decisions, and other pollsters showing that immigrants and Latinos tend to lean more liberal than the average U.S. citizen. The conservative pundit blasted House Republicans as \"sell outs\" in a column on Wednesday for crafting guidelines on immigration that would create a mechanism to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying that the growing Latino population will \"wreck the country.\" To back her assertions, Coulter cites a study by Phyllis Schlafly, a fellow conservative pundit who has called on the Republicans to keep their party as white as possible. Casting aside conventional wisdom, Coulter says that embracing immigration reform would make the Republican Party lose voters. She argues that Latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly Asians, are so liberal on issues including Obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they\u2019ll never vote in large numbers for Republicans. Coulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: \"The only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people.\" In fact, polls routinely show that a majority of Americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by House Republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence. \"Leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed Americans,\" Coulter writes. \"What does it mean for the Republican Party?\" Many observers have concluded that the Republican Party would perform better among Latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like Coulter. Instead, Coulter has argued since Barack Obama\u2019s reelection as president in November that Republicans should ignore the country\u2019s largest ethnic minority altogether. \"The people that Republicans ought to reach out to are white voters,\" Schlaflly said last year during an appearance on conservative radio show Focus Today. \"There is not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican. Actually, there is. Former President George W. Bush pulled 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. Avoiding the approach advocated by folks like Coulter or Schlafly, he spoke some Spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against Latinos during interviews with the media."}

On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, according to the Post and Courier . A prosecutor said the prosecution was moving forward in its case against Loftis. He then went to get gas, cleaned his home with bleach and burned the two bodies, along with his clothes and towels, in the back yard, according to the document. Instead, the warrant said, Loftis retrieved a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, returned to the living room and fired off eight shots, striking both men. Stand-your-ground laws have sparked national debate, especially in the years following the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed African American teenager in Florida. An attorney for George Zimmerman did not invoke it as part of his legal defense, although a member of the jury later told CNN that they had weighed Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground law before finding Zimmerman not guilty in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Nonetheless, a judge in the case granted bail to the 39-year-old, who faces murder charges for fatally shooting the cab driver, 46-year-old Guma Oz Dubar, and the other man, 32-year-old James Cody Newland. Early in the morning on March 5, James Edward Loftis found himself facing two men in his South Carolina home. The men were demanding cab fare for the ride Loftis had just received. Harris said what Loftis did after the shooting was \"heinous,\" according to the Post and Courier. If and when Loftis posts his $250,000 bail \u2014 probably this week, the Post and Courier reported \u2014 he will be on house arrest, allowed only to leave for work, church, or visits with a doctor or his lawyer, according to the Post and Courier. \"They were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site,\" he said.

After police arrived, she showed them bullet holes in the living room, above the couch. Investigators made their way to the backyard and discovered a disturbed patch of dirt. Then, they spoke to Loftis, who explained what happened. \"I\u2019ll get your money,\" he told them, according to his own account given to police and recorded in an arrest warrant soon after. Following the brutal events that early-March morning, Loftis did not call police. His wife did. On Monday, Alfaro, the deputy solicitor, depicted Loftis\u2019s actions in gruesome detail.

{"pred": "The photograph in question was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office on Monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. A group of men standing around a desk: it is not the typical image that goes viral online. Viral images and headlines do not always tell the whole story. So here is an at-a-glance look at what President Trump's executive order means. Many on social media were quick to point out that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling - seen as a landmark case for abortion rights in the US - was delivered by an all-male Supreme Court. And while some people welcomed the move on abortion, others on social media expressed alarm and confusion over what its impact could be. What has all this got to do with Mexico City? It was reinstated when President George W Bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by President Barack Obama in 2009. And now it is back. Is this a step towards banning abortion in the US? And why is it sometimes nicknamed the 'global gag law'? Is President Trump the first to introduce a ban on foreign funding? \"President Trump's immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administration's pro-life priorities,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of US pro-life organisation Susan Anthony List. In an interview with CBS News, Mr Trump said: \"The laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.\" The concern over lack of women at the table comes as Mr Trump's cabinet attracts attention for the high proportion of white, male nominations. What are Mr Trump's views on abortion? Republicans and Democrats have been involved in a political tug-of-war over the issue for decades. \"Men making decisions about women's bodies\" was a much-repeated phrase on Twitter, as it was shared hundreds of thousands of times, including by author JK Rowling. But Democrats later rescinded it under the Clinton administration. Trump's order on abortion policy: What does it mean? Critics of the policy say organisations working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer women full advice on family planning. Republican President Ronald Reagan first created the Mexico City Policy in 1984, stopping funding for international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. Although this policy does not directly affect services in the US, Mr Trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home. Is it unusual to have so many men at the table? The order's official name is the Mexico City Policy because President Reagan first implemented it at a United Nations population conference in Mexico City. On the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed \"some form of punishment\" should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned. If they flout the rules, they lose funding which, in some cases, could threaten certain projects or the whole organisation. His signing of this order as one of his first executive actions indicates he still sees the issue as a priority. This particularly worries women's rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited. The policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\". However, pro-life groups have welcomed the new administration's swift move. Not in itself. This particular executive order is relevant outside of US borders. But, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman. The new US president has previously changed his mind on the issue. He has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest. The Roe v Wade decision says abortion is legal until a foetus is viable, typically between 22 and 24 weeks. No. Like many governmental decisions, the rules on abortion are often determined by male officials.

Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford, wrote in an editorial commentary accompanying the initial report, \"Until [a type H] antitoxin can be created, shown to be effective, and deployed, both the strain itself and the [DNA] sequence of this toxin ... pose serious risks to public health because of the unusually severe, widespread harm that could result from misuse of either.\" C. botulinum has long been known to produce the highly dangerous toxins, giving scientists time to develop antitoxins with which to treat them. But H type, the first new botulinum protein discovered in more than 40 years, is untreatable. A new variant of botulinum toxin, \"type H\" is so dangerous that researchers have decided to withhold publishing information about it, over concern it could be used as a bioweapon. Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that produces the toxic protein, is found in soil. Once ingested, the protein acts as a neurotoxin and can cause a life-threatening paralytic illness known as botulism. New Scientist reported that inhaling just 13 billionths of a gram of the stuff, or an injection of just 2 billionths of a gram, could kill an adult. Yikes. Seven other known strains of the bacterium, labeled after the first seven letters of the alphabet, A - G, are treatable, and only four of them -- A, B, E, and F -- are actually toxic to humans. Of course, C. botulinum also has useful applications, ranging from neuromuscular treatments to Botox for skin wrinkles. \"This is not the usual process for publishing manuscripts,\" Dr. David Hooper, an editor at the Journal of Infectious Diseases, told NPR. \"We thought in this case an exception was appropriate.\""}

Would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes? Time for your weekly edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we\u2019re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more. The dog, I guess. My preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it. Doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible. It\u2019s 8:30 p.m., and the kids are finally asleep ,and I\u2019m just about ready to settle into the recliner when I see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil. Fuck that laundry. I should only have to fold MY clothes. My clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold. My laundry is awesome. My wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week. Let\u2019s say all members of the Beatles and N.W.A are magically revived and/or returned to their artistic primes. The Beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of N.W.A\u2019s best hits, and vice versa. Which album ends up sounding better? The Beatles one, because the Beatles would just take the NWA lyrics and arrange some entirely new Beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty. As much as I like NWA, I don\u2019t wanna hear them butcher \"Blackbird.\" None of those guys could sing. When Diddy ripped off \"Every Breath You Take\" just so he could milk Biggie\u2019s death one more time, I wanted him to fall into a canyon. So I\u2019m getting married in a month, and my fiance\u0301 and I are closing on a house next week. Instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, I am asking that my friends just help me move. My friends feel that this is selfish, and I\u2019m taking advantage of them. We\u2019re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. It\u2019s not like we have a ton of stuff. The plan was that I rent the truck, and we move everything Saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk Saturday night in the new house. I think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it\u2019s my bachelor party, and I should be able to do what I want, right? But screw your friend. All major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. I would just vote for the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, dead center of Manhattan. News crews could get there quickly. Crowds would form. Roasted-nut vendors would make a KILLING. And New Yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the First Contact experience. \"You guys don\u2019t get these aliens. IT\u2019S A NEW YORK THING.\" Email of the week! HALFTIME! Actually, now that I think about it, let\u2019s choose any large park space in any other city. Because Central Park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. It\u2019s hot and overcrowded, and there\u2019s horseshit everywhere. If aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and I would just say FUCK IT and then go home and watch the aliens on TV instead. Corey: Blake: But that\u2019s not a party. You\u2019re asking for free manual labor instead. That doesn\u2019t count as a celebration, you monster. If I threw a party, and everyone came, and then I was like, \"Hey guys, this is a LAUNDRY FOLDING party! Now fold my laundry and I\u2019ll get takeout!\" all my friends would have me killed. You can\u2019t do that. If you want to ask your friends to help you move, that\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t apply that to your party credit. Do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends. Where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? The White House lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. I feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn\u2019t have dedicated aerial security. What do you think? How many albums a year could the top pop stars put out? Beyonce\u0301 could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like Christmas elves. The masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month? I took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop. Kyle: Brian: Now, your letters: But he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it\u2019s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald\u2019s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we\u2019re getting home. Sponsored You know what\u2019s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I\u2019m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you\u2019ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It\u2019s quite something. I might be wrong, but I think once you turn the card in, the pick is final. No backsies, even if it hasn\u2019t been formally announced. If you haven\u2019t turned the card in but GLORY BOY decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him. Switch it and draft Todd Gurley instead. But once the Ginger Hammer has that card, you cannot bend his IRON WILL. \"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying this time,\" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really. Also, I bet John Lennon would REALLY relish pretending to be an inner-city black man. He\u2019d be way too enthusiastic about it. Tom: Steve: Dan: I mean, that\u2019s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth. Aaron: Third choice would be Belichick, because he\u2019d fire everyone and then fuck every Congressman\u2019s wife. And he\u2019d have SO many secrets. Finally, America would have a Putin of its own. SUCK IT, RUSSIA. This actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It\u2019s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was \u2014 does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right? Because that\u2019s too much product! Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyonce\u0301 fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can\u2019t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can\u2019t all be great. Even if they were, you\u2019d still grade them on a curve and have certain \"hits\" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That\u2019s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward. I heard \"Back Off Bitch\" by GNR far more times than anyone should have to endure. Not their best work. I don\u2019t have to do that anymore. Technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan. On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don\u2019t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that\u2019s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place. William: Actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. It\u2019s not welded metal. Robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. My guess is that instead of straight defecation, Robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. That\u2019s what I would do if I were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. RoboCop has no time for poop. I think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over. Danny: I think you\u2019re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don\u2019t care. Of course they care. You\u2019d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they\u2019re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don\u2019t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn\u2019t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it. That\u2019s why Winston\u2019s rape allegations haven\u2019t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel\u2019s drinking did. It\u2019s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That\u2019s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It\u2019s not the boozing. It\u2019s the fact that they don\u2019t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn\u2019t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft. The Great Jameis Winston Whitewashing Kevin: I used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this. I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. YES AMERICA, I helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard\u2019s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ME, PLEEEEEEEZ. Mike: I don\u2019t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there\u2019s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell\u2019s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won\u2019t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he\u2019s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I\u2019m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel\u2019s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren\u2019t they even mentioning it? The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he\u2019s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn\u2019t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH! If tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in America as the POTUS for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job? Give me your top 3, and provide reasons why. It has to be a public figure\u2014don\u2019t get all sappy and say your dad, or your awesome 2nd-grade teacher. Also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the White House. (By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota\u2019s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven\u2019t learned to be sick of him yet.) How does Robocop poop? He has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow. There are calls for Obama\u2019s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so I assume a @Luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. \"More like Marco Boob-io, AMIRITE?!\" That tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d actually resign, though. After all, plenty of politicians out there already use Twitter for trolling purposes. And we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you\u2019re willing to sit there and ride it out. You let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal. Ape Chemist: \"You\u2019re not lying this time, are you?\" I asked him. \"If you\u2019re lying, I\u2019ll never stop for you to poop again.\" The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don\u2019t like cracking so many of them. I am not a crackpot. It\u2019s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. Ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? It\u2019s a complete pain in the ass. I need you to go away for a while so that I can grow to love you again. Whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, I can promise you that you NEVER want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. Half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid. What happened if it came out that President Obama had a Twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously? I\u2019m not saying one of his staffers was doing this\u2014this was how Barry O passed the time while on the shitter. Would there be calls for impeachment/resignation? How long would the media blow that up for? What would his Twitter handle be? Would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo? Are BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I\u2019m suspicious of the whole thing. But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston\u2019s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can\u2019t possibly know him all that well: But the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can\u2019t hurt you at all! That\u2019s science. I know it\u2019s lame to pick a captain of industry for that job, but I don\u2019t want a fucking actor. I don\u2019t want some comedian like Jon Stewart or Louis CK who would hate the job instantly. A good president needs to believe his own horseshit, and Musk and/or Tim Cook would more than fulfill that requirement. Drew Magary writes for Deadspin. He\u2019s also a correspondent for GQ. Follow him on Twitter @drewmagary and email him at drew@deadspin.com. You can also order Drew\u2019s book, Someone Could Get Hurt, through his homepage. Suppose during the first round of the NFL draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends. This all takes place while the team is on the clock, so Goodell has yet to announce the pick. While celebrating, the player\u2014like Lamarr Houston or Bill Gramatica\u2014tears his ACL. Assume the team hasn\u2019t officially announced the pick. Does the NFL let the team withdraw the pick? I remember when the Vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn\u2019t get their card in on time, so I could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn\u2019t official until the card is turned in and read. I hope this happens to some team like the Cowboys, and Jerry sends someone onstage to tackle Goodell before he reaches the podium. That said, if I had to vote for one random famous person to be dropped into the Oval Office for the next eight years, I\u2019m picking Elon Musk. I need a VISIONARY, man. I want Musk to divert all defense spending into building a giant water slide from New York to L.A. Every other issue facing the country would be solved if such a water slide existed. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done. I won\u2019t hear it. I do think he\u2019d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho. The Obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide. \"To me, I think he\u2019s told us an awful lot with how he\u2019s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He\u2019s gone through it a couple years now, and he\u2019s answered the bell. That\u2019s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that\u2019s what he\u2019s been able to do.\" Well, look, it\u2019s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. Pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, \"Bill Kristol says you have nice teeth.\" That\u2019s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in America at the present moment. They should probably make you take a test or something."}

We have to declare peace on the safety net.\" \"One of the things, in my view, that we get wrong in the free enterprise movement is this war against the social safety net, which is just insane,\" Brooks said. The top conservative considered the partisan discourse surrounding support for those who need it, saying the far left calls for endless amounts of relief, while the far right calls for enterprise. Arthur Brooks, president of the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, is challenging Republicans to reconsider their aversion to welfare programs. During the \"Right To Rise: Education as America\u2019s 21st Century Ticket to Social Mobility\" event, Brooks recalled recent visits to \"off the map\" areas neglected by politicians because they're home to voters who are either certain they'll vote for them or certain they won't. After speaking with people in the areas -- \"prostitutes, drug addicts, ex-felons, homeless people\" -- Brooks said they called for three things. \"Transformation, relief and opportunity, in that order,\" he said. Brooks' comments came weeks before an automatic decrease to food stamp benefits set for Nov. 1, in which the average family will see a $36 cut in their benefits."}

{"pred": "Here\u2019s a sample interaction between the chatbot and a student. (Courtesy Ashok Goel) Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn\u2019t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot\u2019s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don\u2019t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor\u2019s overworked teaching staff. At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM. There are many questions Jill can\u2019t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants. Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn\u2019t human. But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot. As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson\u2019s true identity to students until after they\u2019d turned in their final exams. Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course\u2019s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions. Students were amazed. \"I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!\" wrote one in the class\u2019s online forum. \"Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!\" said another. \"I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,\" Goel said. To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class\u2019s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered. Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill\u2019s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \"Where can I find assignment two?\" and \"When is assignment two due?\" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. \"To me this is a grand challenge,\" Goel said. \"Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.\" The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate."}

{"pred": "Ever Wondered What Are those White Lines on Your Smartphone? Here's the Answer Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language. What Actually Are Those White Lines? You might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines. The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals. We are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why? Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. We don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides. Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back. Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better. Asus Manufactured the Invisible Band Smartphone Apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. Following the footprints of Apple, there are many manufacturers such as OnePlus, HTC, Meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. However, some of them look really good such as the OnePlus 3, Meizu MX6. Smartphones design has evolved a lot in recent times with several manufacturers such as Apple, Motorola, Google, HTC, Sony taking the initiatives in manufacturing a good looking smartphone. Asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. The ZenFone 3 Series are the first smartphones in the world to launch with invisible bands even with the metal body. The trend these days have been the unibody metal design which is becoming the next plastic thing for the smartphones. There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body. Are they harmful? Who Started This? Followed by?"}

Usually such a sitting would require (at least) a rack of clothing and a team of assistants led by the magazine\u2019s fashion and style director, Jessica Diehl. Alas, a Vanity Fair spokesperson has confirmed, there was no stylist for this cover, and no designers credited. Zuckerberg wore his own clothes, saving everyone involved in the cover shoot from wasting their brain capacity on fashion. When I saw the new cover, with Zuckerberg in his signature grey tee and blue jeans, I wondered whether Diehl had styled the cover in a genius homage to the Facebook founder\u2019s personal uniform. In the past, he has attributed his perennial look to a desire to focus his energy on important business decisions, rather than what he characterized as \"silly or frivolous\" choices, such as what to wear. (The personal uniform here becomes the fashion analog of meal-replacement beverage Soylent.) Despite Diehl\u2019s recent statement that the magazine\u2019s cover \"is not your casual-jeans Tuesday\" (in reference to Vanity Fair\u2019s issue starring Caitlyn Jenner), Zuckerberg\u2019s Tuesday cover suggests otherwise.

Commercial availability of the Micro Bit follows the signing of a licensing deal with the device's manufacturer, the Leeds-based company, element 14. The Micro Bit was meant to be the flagship of the BBC's Make It Digital season last year but suffered a number of delays. It started arriving in schools this spring and the BBC says it has now been delivered to about 80% of schools and roughly 750,000 Year 7 children (11 and 12-year olds). The Micro Bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices. Element 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the BBC and Micro Bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy. Image caption Owners of the Micro Bit can write code for it via a website designed by Microsoft Image caption Until now, only Year 7 schoolchildren in the UK had access to their own Micro Bits Image caption The Micro Bit will be more than double the price of the Raspberry Pi Zero mini-computer But retailers including Microsoft, the Technology Will Save Us organisation and Sciencescope will offer individual devices. It is late in the year - although the Micro Bits belong to the children who will take them home over the summer holidays. A number have told me that the Micro Bit has arrived far too late in the school year to be of much use - \"starting after half term, it's come far too late to get proper use out of it, plus concerns about handling/failures\" was one comment this morning. They could decide it is worthwhile investing in the devices now they are going to be available to buy. And there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again. The real test, however, will be whether schools and parents decide that the next Year 7 children will benefit from getting their own Micro Bits. Now it will also be available to buy from the various partners in the project for \u00a312.99. Element 14 is part of Premier Farnell, one of the distributors of the very successful Raspberry Pi barebones computer. Richard Curtin, strategic alliance director at element 14, is expecting a similar reception for the Micro Bit. But if it does prove as good a seller as the Raspberry Pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more Year 7 children getting their hands on one. The device is already being delivered, free, to one million Year 7 children in schools across the UK. While I have heard plenty of enthusiasm from those children who have got their hands on it - and there are already plenty of exciting projects on display - there have also been frustrations from teachers. \"It's going to be huge,\" he told me.\"We've already got a pipeline of orders including foreign governments who've seen what has happened in the UK.\" The firm says it will only sell them in batches of 90. But another teacher said this: \"Got ours just before Easter hols. Kids are loving using them and are even buying add-ons for them, building projects at home etc.\" Media caption Rishworth School sent a Micro Bit into the stratosphere The hope must be that their enthusiasm will continue as they join Year 8 in September, though of course there is a risk that their devices will be lost or broken by then."}

Rob Mrowka, a scientist with the Center for Biological diversity, said the Bundy cattle are essentially \"feral,\" roaming at will over hundreds of thousands of acres \u2014 including far outside the range where long ago they were permitted. (Bundy stopped paying his grazing fees in 1993, meaning the cattle were technically trespassing anywhere on public land after that point.) Bundy is currently behind bars awaiting trial after being arrested in February at Portland airport on charges stemming from his role in the tense 2014 standoff with federal officials near his Nevada ranch. \"The environmentalists say that it\u2019s bad for the tortoise if you have cattle on the land, that\u2019s false,\" Hansen said. \"The tortoises do better with the cattle on the land because they like to make a meal out of the cow pies.

Hansen disagreed that cattle harm tortoise habitat."}

{"pred": "Like many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access. Ripcord\u2019s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they\u2019re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer. With billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that\u2019s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord\u2019s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software. The machines aren\u2019t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn\u2019t putting people out of work, it\u2019s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached. Ripcord isn\u2019t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It\u2019s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord. Ripcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn\u2019t made it into the information age \u2013 billions of boxes of paper files.

They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions. Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing \"terrible human and economic cost\", a major study has warned. Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report\u2019s authors warn. Antibiotics crisis is global 4/4 Antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O\u2019Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK. Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe 4 show all Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 such as MRSA develop. The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050. 2/4 Amoxicillin, the commonest antibiotic prescribed by GPs 3/4 Antibiotic resistance cycle It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O\u2019Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use. Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock. Lord O\u2019Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I\u2019m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\" Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\" Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA) Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report\u2019s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O\u2019Neill\u2019s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is.

Watching from a ledge behind him was Kaity Thomson, a recent University of New Hampshire graduate, who'd come to hear Rubio with her co-worker and friend Yuxi Wang. \"We were expecting pancakes,\" said Thomson, who is now working for 350.org, the international environmental citizens pressure group. \"It's crazy.\" Thomson, still undecided, did come away with something she could believe in, though: \"The visiting captain's story ... I think it was really moving and inspiring.\" There were no pancakes at the pancake breakfast. Still, she admitted, it's been difficult to predict how things are going. \"I thought Jeb had it. I thought he was a shoo-in,\" when the race first got underway. After Bush began to founder, \"I thought Marco would have walked away with it. But after last night...\" she gave a little shrug. \"I hope this morning is the Marco we want to see.\" Merrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. \"I don't know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice. As the pancake-less attendees exited the school cafeteria, Merrill's \"very strong ground game\" was in action. Two young Rubio volunteers tried to nail down the vote, asking attendees to sign an \"I Pledge to Vote for Rubio\" The responses: So went Marco Rubio's morning after, the morning after an Ambien-esque nightmare of a debate performance where Chris Christie repeatedly pounced on him for reciting the same anti-Obama talking point, nearly word for word, four times. \"There it is!\" gleeful scorekeeper Christie called on ball three, \"The memorized 25-second speech!\" Rubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate's debate performance was getting. \"I think it's a narrow band of folks who read each other on Twitter,\" Jim Merrill, a Rubio senior advisor for New Hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. \"We're going to focus on President Obama.\" Any slip of the gears isn't going to affect Tuesday's results. \"We have a very strong ground game.\" Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. Isn't there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\" But afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio's response. \"Last time I heard him say it,\" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, \"he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait.\" This time \"he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it.\" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because \"this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask.\" Folksy Capt. Dan Kipnis, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization. Capt. Dan Kipnis, member of the Miami-Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force. Capt.

The cardboard costumed Rubio-bots mechanically handing out broken gaskets were not New Hampshire voters. Londonderry High School was greeted first by two cardboard and tinfoil robots, who mechanically droned Rubio's now-defining line, \"Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC's deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign's only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible. It didn't get better. He's still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he's decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position. Belichick, too.\" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, \"Well, I'm going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\" At least 50 percent of the 800 or so attendees were not New Hampshire voters. His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday's Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids. Some Christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. \"They waited for me to drive away,\" to make sure she didn't replace one of their Christie signs with a Bush sign. \"Christie's people, they are street fighters.\" Durant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. \"There are ten of us here,\" she noted, \"and only one of us is a New Hampshire voter.\" That would be her cousin, Tom Stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from Ohio to New Hampshire two years ago. He's still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week. Now, she's undecided, too. We just came up from Massachusetts. \"Thank you for making the drive,\" one volunteer repeatedly responded. It grew a little wearying. \"Nobody is,\" he started, and then corrected himself, \"There are a few people from New Hampshire.\" Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, 'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"'Well, it won't prevent any sea rise.'

We never expected Kim Kardashian\u2019s at-home skincare routine to consist of run-of-the-mill products anybody could get, but a recent Snapchat showed that Kim surely does NOT play around when it comes to her morning beauty ritual. According to Us Weekly, Kim snapped a photo of four products all from the luxurious La Mer brand \u2014 The Perfecting Treatment, The Concentrate, The Renewal Oil, and the iconic Cre\u0300me de la Mer. The total cost for this high-end skin treatment? A whopping $1,230. That\u2019s rent money, people. Kim also made sure to say that she wasn\u2019t getting paid for promoting the product, which can be considered more proof that La Mer may very well live up to its hype. While some of us might only be able to fantasize about using La Mer in our own morning skincare routines, we still might be able to try another favorite of Kim\u2019s, such as Kiko\u2019s Scrub & Peel wipes by the Italian cosmetics brand, Kiko Milano. For decades, La Mer has been the cre\u0300me de la cre\u0300me (no pun intended) when it comes to facial moisturizers. The brand\u2019s website claims it has the power to completely \"transform the skin,\" and making it look \"virtually ageless.\" With those statements, it\u2019s no wonder La Mer is a longtime favorite of makeup artists and celebs, as well as the source of legend \u2014 Mariah Carey was once rumored to use La Mer as diaper cream for her babies and Jennifer Lopez was said to have applied the stuff on her body from head to toe. Could you imagine? If you can get your hands on them, the exfoliating wipes only go for about 6 pounds, or around $8.50 USD. That sounds way more doable than $1230!"}

{"pred": "Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day? All this isn\u2019t to suggest that Americans never mark Veterans Day and Memorial Day. In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don\u2019t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn\u2019t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn\u2019t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn\u2019t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War\u2014amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day. Differences in how military holidays are observed can\u2019t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America\u2019s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn\u2019t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America\u2019s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date\u2014and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone\u2014one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America\u2019s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS\u2019s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world\u2014and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement."}
{"pred": "Research has found that salaries at men and women\u2019s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. The gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children. How to Bridge That Stubborn Pay Gap One solution, Ms. Babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations. Ms. Goldin of Harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. The gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. Then, women aren\u2019t penalized as much for working fewer hours. Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits. Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees\u2019 arguments in wage bargaining. \"Even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms,\" he said. Men are paid more partly because they\u2019re much more likely to ask for it. If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries. When employers publish people\u2019s salaries, the pay gap shrinks. Policies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. In states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found. So what might work to close the gap? Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O of Salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women\u2019s salaries equal to men\u2019s. Kimberly-Clark and PricewaterhouseCoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions. The strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in California this month. It says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal Equal Pay Act requires. The California law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay. When receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students by Linda Babcock, an economist at the university. In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested. In August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee\u2019s previous salary when setting his or her new one. The acting director, Beth Cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. Women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors. Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found. A few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. President Obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the Labor Department. Other American companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately. Publish Everyone\u2019s Pay \"If a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that\u2019s not the same as making a career choice,\" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. \"One thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers.\" Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers. Sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. Sometimes their employers assume they\u2019ll do so, even if they don\u2019t. \"Don\u2019t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\" Ms. Babcock said. \"I think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\" Make Work Easier for Mothers That has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men. Don\u2019t Rely on Previous Salaries Proposed federal legislation known as the Paycheck Fairness Act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier. But that legislation is stalled in Congress. But her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. (As the actress Jennifer Lawrence wrote in Lenny after the Sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn\u2019t fight for more because \"I didn\u2019t want to seem \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018spoiled.\u2019 \") \"We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,\" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter. Build More Flexible Workplaces Companies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. In a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient. To Negotiate, or Not Google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth. Change the Law Federal law doesn\u2019t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics."}
{"pred": "When\u2019s the best time to share on Facebook? However, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal \"best times\" to share content on Facebook. Interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume. The natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country? CoSchedule, Fast Company, HubSpot, ShortStack, Forbes, Hootsuite, QuickSprout and others all claim to have the answers to such seemingly simple questions as \"When is the best time to post on Facebook?\" and \"How often should you post stories on Facebook?\" We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\u2019t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries. As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times. It\u2019s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category \u2014 optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns. We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences \u2014 when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing. There\u2019s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts. But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance \u2014 with large social media teams and even data scientists. Again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day. We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough. Overall, the sports publisher\u2019s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content. Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.

He\u2019s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it\u2019s time to put the many demises into perspective. So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park\u2018s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.) Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list? However, even though Bean has perfected his \"I\u2019m dying\" face, he still hasn\u2019t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies. It looks like the \"walking spoiler\" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them \u2014 almost a third of his films. Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene. But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt\u2019s death percentage is similar to Bean\u2019s \u2014 around 30% \u2014 but just seeing the list of Hurt\u2019s 43* deaths is impressive. *UPDATED: This post originally missed Hurt\u2019s three most recent movie deaths and now includes more actors in the graph (thanks commenters)!

{"pred": "God Hates Gays Who Own Chandeliers? The Folks at Ivory & Deene Seem to Think So To them, a chandelier is a holy object ordained by God to illuminate the rooms of only those who seek His approval and judgment. Consequently, homosexuals certainly aren't fit to hang such a blessed and holy fixture in a stage production where faggotry and fabulousness are main themes. The chandelier in tonight's performance comes from Ivory & Deene's collection of exquisite heteronormative lighting. To find out if you yourself are fit to own these fine straight-people products, ask yourself this: \"Do I like gay sex?\" Something tells me that God loves a good chandelier. After all, they are grandiose and self-righteous in a way that only a person with great power and questionable taste could truly appreciate. And the folks over at Ivory & Deene home furnishings completely concur. It seemed that an elaborate (read: gaudy) chandelier, preferably red in color, should hang dramatically over the live rock band that is part of the show. Our hunt led us to the lovely, Christian businesspeople at Ivory & Deene. Impressed by the ornate lighting fixtures and reasonable prices, we decided to contact the management to see if we could negotiate a discounted price, as our theater company is a nonprofit with a very limited budget. What did we have to lose? We thought that the worst thing they could say was \"no,\" but it turns out that that's not the worst thing they could say. Here's what they did say to our producer Will: This question might also help you determine whether or not you'll dig our show. Hope to see you there. There will be chandeliers. Perhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from Ruby and hang it proudly on our set. I also have a full page of ad space that I don't know what to do with. Maybe this: As we prepare to open our production of God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert Live From Hell in New York City next month, we've been on the prowl for set dressings and items befitting a cabaret room located in the pits of Hell -- the setting of our play, which imagines the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper having been damned to the underworld for all eternity. Punctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, Ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. (If you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) She seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the Bible. (God did not say \"very good\" when he created man and woman. Look it up.) And rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, Ruby decided to do the least Christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. She may not have called us \"faggots,\" but she might as well have. God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert Live From Hell runs Oct. 16-20 at HERE in New York City. For more information, visit godhatesthisshow.com. The truth is, Ruby can't be nai\u0308ve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. But the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for Ruby and Ivory & Deene to turn their heads the other way. Only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue. I worry about Ruby. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. I mean, come on. Girl is selling amazing satin sheets. Whether she knows it or not, Ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. We're screwing on your sheet sets, Ruby. And in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. Just thought you'd like to know. You're gay by association. Find a shower. Quick.

Oh, and he had to walk to work and back. Derrick Taylor works at a UPS centre five miles from his home, where he loads and unloads vans with packages. And he starts work at 4am. Taylor had a driving license, but couldn't afford a car. That was, until his co-workers clubbed together and bought one for him. Taylor says he was too proud to ask for lifts from his co-workers. As he was presented the car, his colleague said he wanted Taylor to know everyone appreciated his \"hard work\".

{"pred": "The One Place This Google Executive Won't Take Her Phone The truth is, that during class, I never looked at my phone. But one time I did and it became a reminder for how sacred the space should really be. My boss emailed me, during the break, between the barre and the floor exercise and I had just decided to check my email. Email draws you in and there\u2019s always some action item -- something that triggers a response. Bonita Stewart is Vice President of Partner Business Solutions at Google. As told to Meredith Melnick. This interview was edited and condensed for space and clarity. And though I didn't typically look at my phone, once I set up the rule that I would not look at my phone for those 90 minutes, it became a new form of self-discipline and a gift to myself of 90 minutes in which everything else can wait. Is there one place you choose to honor with your full attention? Our \"Sacred Spaces\" series explores where your phone is unwelcome. From the mundane to the truly unique -- from yoga class to family dinner to your bath tub -- we are spotlighting the environments where you are truly unplugged. Want to share your own? Send us your story here. For the rest of the class, it made it much more difficult to concentrate. Remembering the exercise, going across the floor. That one email check pulled into class what I should be doing after class. I lost being in the moment, being present and the joy faded. I realized that I had invaded my sacred space with technology. I\u2019ve been taking ballet all my life since I was very young, and while I did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. As an undergraduate [at Howard University], at Harvard Business School, and as I moved to different cities -- Denver, Boston, Detroit, New York -- I'd always find a ballet studio. It just brings me so much joy to dance. Everyone who is there has opted in simply because they love ballet and they enjoy dancing. So there's something about being with the like-minded women (and some men!) who are there with me. To me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. And something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. In this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way. Something about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. It became this sacred space. And though it was a place that was all my own -- where I could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself."}
{"pred": "SalesforceVoice: 3 Ways To Make Your Company More Sales Intelligent Becoming Sales Intelligent Sales intelligence is critical to your company's growth. What obstacles are preventing you from embracing these tools, and what would inspire more confidence in them? The greatest virtue of sales intelligence tools is that they save so much time. You most likely hired your reps on the basis of their sales acumen, not their stellar research skills. Rather than having them spend hours scouring the internet for details about prospects, intelligence tools get them to the right people and companies faster. Cultivate a passion for productivity among your sales teammates. They'll be thrilled to try out new platforms that provide them with more time to do what they do best: sell. You've heard of street smarts and book smarts. But is your company sales smart? If you're like most organizations, the answer is probably not really. Sales teams face two perennial problems. No matter their industries or how large their companies, most lack a properly implemented training regimen and the resources to do their jobs efficiently. Sales managers often tell me they're reluctant to adopt sales intelligence platforms because the tools aren't intuitive. They may have watched a demo video or presentation and come away feeling more confused than they were to begin with. If you've experienced this, know that the fault probably lies more with the sales rep who led the demo than with the product itself. Have patience and seek out the features that are relevant to your organization. Still, the concept of sales intelligence is relatively new. Sales managers and executives are understandably wary of investing in tools and strategies if they're not clear on how the business will benefit. Sales intelligence tools improve efficiency and can increase conversions and profits. But they're effective only if you approach them correctly. Here's how to build sales intelligence within your company: Sales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. It includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. The better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. That's Sales 101. But sales intelligence platforms enable you to put that concept to work by building more detailed profiles than were possible in the past. A few years ago, they would have used simple Google searches and corporate websites to piece together this information. Now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their CRMs, and schedule drip campaigns. In this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments. This is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before. Organizations that rely heavily on cold-calling for lead generation need to know whom to target and how to reach them with actionable messages. The big questions with new tools are always: How much will this cost? And what's the ROI? Analyze the amount of time and resources that can be saved using different platforms. Then, compare that with the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the new systems. That will tell you whether sales intelligence is worth the investment. Usually, the answer is yes. Modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs. 1. Emphasize productivity. You can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it. 3. Investigate key features. 2. Evaluate potential ROI."}

I didn\u2019t,\" Brown wrote on her blog September 15. \"Tough little lady\" Abigail Ann Brown was born March 4, and Brown, now a breastfeeding mother of a four-month-old, competes in the first round of the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials in the 1500m race in Eugene, Oregon, Thursday. Though she never gave up her training \u2014 taking just a week off from exercise when she gave birth under her doctor's supervision \u2014 Brown has also been savoring her moments with her newborn while on the road to Rio. Before Abigail was born, Brown wrote a letter to her on her blog. \"My quest to continue training for the Olympic Trials will never compare to the continuous quest I will be on to be the best mother for you,\" she wrote. Olympic hopeful Sarah Brown, 29, did not expect to get pregnant the year before she planned to go to Rio. Like any new mother, Brown is learning how to adapt to her new life; she\u2019s just figuring out sleep schedules and breastfeeding in between workouts and foam rolling. In one Instagram post, she used the hashtag #Mommyintraining \u2014 \"double meaning intended,\" she added. Brown joins other new moms and elite runners like Clara Peterson and fellow Olympic hopeful Stephanie Rothstein Bruce, determined to show the world just how strong mothers are. But despite a copper IUD (\"I am the less than 1 percent,\" Brown wrote on her blog, for whom the birth control method is not effective), Brown and her husband and coach, Darren Brown, found themselves expecting a baby girl early last fall \u2014 just as her Olympic training was supposed to kick into high gear.

John Glenn Said Space Flight Made His Faith in God Stronger In the late 1990s Glenn, among other NASA astronauts lucky enough to go to space to touch the face of God, insisted that his religious faith was made stronger by his experience in space. So, as we remember the life and works of John Glenn, let us recall too his faith in a God that brought him such comfort, a God that created this awe inspiring universe full of wonder. God speed, indeed, but God was also there all along, according to Glenn. The famed astronaut, a devout Presbyterian, also noted that he was praying every day during his second historic flight in space. The Tweet from NASA announcing his passing hints at that something: The passing of John Glenn, one of America\u2019s most famous NASA astronauts, marks the end of an era for American exceptionalism. While many will focus on the scientific miracle that allowed Glenn to become the first American to orbit the earth, Glenn himself noted that God was also an inseparable part of that miracle. But Glenn said something else that may be overlooked as the nation reviews his life and times. Big Government, faith, John Glenn, NASA \"Love of country was a given.

{"pred": "What Is The Real Monetary Value Of The Rio Olympics Gold Medal? The \"podium value\" of the gold medal at the Rio 2016 Olympics is approximately $564 , based on the price of gold at $43.76 per gram and the price of sterling silver at 61 cents per gram, as of Thursday. This is in line with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). However, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 London gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time. If the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded. The front of each medal has the Rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient Olympics). The reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the Greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the Greek Panathnaic Stadium in the background. Above Nike is the engraving of \"XXXI Olympiad\" and the Olympic Rings. Adding a personal touch, the name of the event in which the medal was awarded is engraved by laser along its outer edge. The Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games is being billed as the \"Biggest Sporting Event on the Planet.\" It\u2019s difficult to argue against that claim as more than 11,000 athletes will be competing in 28 sports and 42 disciplines for the event\u2019s ultimate prize: the gold medal. A total of 2,488 medals were produced for the Rio 2016 Olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the Mint of Brazil. All of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the Summer Olympics and tied for the largest medal in the Summer games. At least three Winter Olympic medals were larger and heavier. Even the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles). Each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the Rio 2016 logo. Each of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver. The podium value is about $305. The 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%). The bronze medals have little intrinsic value. The medals were produced with methods that the Rio 2016 Olympic officials described as \"symbols of sustainability and accessibility .\" More than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and X-ray plates. The gold is mined entirely free of mercury. More than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the Mint of Brazil through a process that was developed internally. The 2,642 Paralympic award medals were made by the Mint of Brazil and are of the same weight, dimensions and materials as the Olympic medals. The design is highlighted by a trail of seeds that wraps from the front to the reverse side of the medal. Olympic officials say the seeds represent \"the courage, persistence and development of athletes.\" The Rio 2016 Paralympic Games logo is on both sides of the medal, with Braille inscriptions on the front side. For the first time in history, according to Rio Olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm. Each of the 812 Olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the International Olympic Committee) with 99.9 percent purity. The remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 92.5 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the Mint of Brazil. The purity silver standard also is a minimum IOC requirement. Paralympic medals with new sound innovation More than 100 employees in various professional fields\u2014including, art, sustainability, engineering and production\u2014were involved in the making of the 5,130 medals. For the first time the medals come with sound, so visually impaired athletes can identify the medal\u2019s color . Metal ball bearings were placed inside the medals which rattle when shaken. The gold medal makes the loudest noise and the bronze the weakest. Anthony DeMarco is founder of the Jewelry News Network.

{"pred": "\"Chewbacca Mom\" Shares The REAL Reason Her Video Blew Up The Internet Candace Payne\u2019s video went viral not just because she\u2019s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true). Her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is FILLED with the love and joy of Jesus. And God used a beautiful daughter from Texas, in a Chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic Star Wars toy to bring joy to people\u2019s lives. Don\u2019t believe me? As if the record-breaking 133 Million views isn\u2019t enough (that\u2019s more views than Mark Zuckerberg has friends, by the way), then listen to the response of people who watched her video: But just hours after her video blew up the internet, Payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we \u2013 for the first time \u2013 have begun to understand why Candace\u2019s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as Chewbacca in the front seat of a car. Candace shared on Candace shared on Good Morning America that the best note she received as a result of her video is from a mom who has a daughter with autism who laughed over and over for the first time in over two months as she watched Candace\u2019s hilarious stunt. The newest member of the \"Gone Viral\" club is none other than Texas native Candace Payne. A wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, Payne seemed to be all over your Facebook Newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a Facebook Live video of her unboxing a \"Chewbacca\" mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral. So with a smile that\u2019s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the \"Chewie\" mask out of the box and put it on. I was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time I watched Candace\u2019s hilarious video. I\u2019ve seen plenty of viral videos before \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s a part of my job. But something is different about Candace Payne. In the age of viral media, it\u2019s not uncommon for a video to go crazy viral or a post to been seen by millions of eyes. We\u2019re talking \u2013 \"It broke the internet.\" Then laughter ensued. Candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn\u2019t contain the belly laugh that came out of her. And as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious. To the point that she couldn\u2019t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes. A few minutes later, Candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be \"responsible\" as she puts it, and pick up her children from school. But with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn\u2019t contain herself and decided to do an \u2018unboxing\u2019 in her car and show her friends on Facebook her new find. Literally, Candace Payne\u2019s video has set new records as being the most-viewed Facebook Live video with over 133 MILLION views. \"From one mama heart to another mama, to see a child laugh that you haven\u2019t seen laugh, those are the stories that I\u2019m going to take with me everyday,\" said Candace. And that\u2019s not all of the mic drop moments Candace spoke. Take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the Regional Fine Arts event: Just 48 hours after her video had gone viral, Candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an Arts conference in Texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from Heaven. Candace is no ordinary \"15-minute-famer.\" In fact, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Candace\u2019s influence extends long past 15 minutes. But here\u2019s where her words get really good. We see it all the time: from the announcement of Sarah Palin as a running mate in 2008; thrusting her into the spotlight from obscurity, to the boy who cried \"Damn Daniel\" on Vine and ended up on the Ellen show and just about everywhere else. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame. And apparently Candace agrees with me as she said this morning on Good Morning America : \"I honestly wasn\u2019t there for the mask,\" Payne told \"I honestly wasn\u2019t there for the mask,\" Payne told Good Morning America . \"I was there for myself for some yoga pants because I\u2019m trying to work out more. And it\u2019s not really going that well, but I ended up going to the toy section because I got discouraged about the yoga pants and I thought, \u2018Maybe not today. But I can get a toy for my kids.\u2019 And I walk through the toy section and I accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box. And I had seen this before, but I didn\u2019t realize it made sounds until that moment. It accidentally started making the growl, and I went, \u2018I need to get that. Like, I don\u2019t think my kids need that, I think I need that.\u2019\" She walked into Kohl\u2019s to buy yoga pants, but little did Candace know that God had other plans for her. Not only is Payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she\u2019s someone who loves Jesus too. And boy does it show. Candace is active in her church, The Oaks Fellowship in Red Oak, Texas (just outside of Dallas) and she\u2019s a dedicated wife and momma. \"I think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh. I think we\u2019re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism \u2014 worldwide.\" In fact, never before in history has someone had the ability to be plucked from obscurity and rise to a national \u2014 or international \u2014 platform as quickly as in this 21st century digital age. The world is hungry \u2014 no, they\u2019re starving \u2014 for the joy of the Lord. The Bible says that His joy is our strength. If you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking God to give you His joy and then belly-laugh along with Candace. Then go and spread your joy with others and you\u2019ll find that your joy will be always flowing. \"When I was 16, I had a vision and a dream from the Lord about my future being used for His glory. I didn\u2019t understand the interpretation of it. I still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out. But that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that I walk and follow Jesus. And I know that God has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, I feel like I wake up and I\u2019m a Jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because I have that creative buzz in me, constantly going,\" said Candace. Thank you so much Candace Payne for sharing the joy of the Lord that is inside of you with the world. You have no idea how inspiring you really are... Or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the Spirit come out of you so freely. Either way, thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts for bringing more joy to the world through your laugh and letting your light shine. Often, a hallmark of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in your life is joy. And many times that comes in the form of laughter \u2014 deep, beautiful laughter \u2014 that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others. One of the markers of Jesus\u2019 work in your life is that you have joy. It doesn\u2019t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren\u2019t words to explain. \"I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in Him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 15:13 \"Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord\u2019s people.\" -Philemon 1:7 \"For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 14:17 \"Those who have been ransomed by the LORD will return. They will enter Jerusalem singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be filled with joy and gladness.\" -Isaiah 35:10 \"It doesn\u2019t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you\u2019re not fit to do the things that God has called you to do... And that is spiritually fit. The thing that will take you further and farther in the Kingdom of God is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience... Do not try to make a name for yourself. His name will always outshadow yours.\" -Candace Payne"}
{"pred": "Traditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy. To understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments. Realistic Optimists May Have More Success And Happiness, Study Suggests These realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said Sophia Chou, an organizational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, who presented her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Honolulu, Hawaii earlier this month. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy] The findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said. As it turns out, some people can be both. So-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found. Past research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. But a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, Chou said. Being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said. Optimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall. After several years working in business, Chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. She wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed. Optimists and pessimists She found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships. So Chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in Taiwan. The surveys tested how many \"positive illusions\" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality. That allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present. In order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said. \"Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement,\" Chou said. Interestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, Chou said. Are you a \"glass half-full\" or a \"glass half-empty\" kind of person? The optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists. \"Every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won't say 'I have no choice and this is the only thing I can do.' They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,\" Chou said. Realistic views Self-control key"}

It was a question as to whether or not that advocacy needed to happen in that environment.\" Rep. Kevin Elmer (R-Nixa) reportedly tweeted Thursday: \"Nixa Schools failure.

Still, students at the school and gay rights advocates are firing back at the state representative. A Missouri lawmaker caused a firestorm of controversy last week after he tweeted disparaging comments about teens wearing T-shirts that support gay-straight alliances. Elmer had been at a book fair at his third-grade child\u2019s school when he saw several teens wearing the shirts. He told the Leader that he took issue with those garments being worn around young students, as he felt their message could interfere with his ability to parent on issues such as same-sex relationships. @KevinElmer you see a tshirt that says \"GAY\".

J.K.Rowling let slip these hints about what has happened to our favorite characters, and the Wizarding World in general. 4/33. Harry lost the ability to speak Parseltongue when Voldemorts soul fragment was destroyed. 2/33. After his death, Voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that Harry sees in the Kings Cross-like Limbo. 13/33. Harry will not train to be an animagus 10/33. Harry would take his family to visit Dudleys when they were in the neighbourhood (occasions dreaded by James, Albus and Lily). 15/33. Hermione Granger was the only member of the trio who returned to Hogwarts to complete their seventh year. Harry, Ron and Neville went straight to get training as aurors.  9/33. Hagrid was still working at Hogwarts by 2017, at 88 years old. He never married, although he had a relationship with a giantess. 18/33. Ron worked with George in Weasleys Wizard Wheezes prior to officially becoming an auror. 19/33. After the war was over, Hermiones first act was to find her parents in Australia and restore their memories. Harrys was to make sure that the Wizarding world knew that Snape was a hero and on Dumbledores side. 12/33. Kingsley Shacklebolt became the Minister of Magic after the Second Wizarding War. 8/33. The remaining Death Eaters were killed or imprisoned in Azkaban for their crimes, with the exception of the Malfoys. Draco and Harry never became friends, but they did come to understand and appreciate each other better. 17/33. The head of the Auror Office as of 2007 is Harry Potter. Harry will never become Headmaster of Hogwarts since an academic career just isnt him. 1/33. Dolores Umbridge was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned for crimes against Muggleborns. 11/33. Nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (McGonagall was really getting on a bit) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemorts death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year. 16/33. After serving as an auror for a number of years, Neville Longbottom eventually moved on to serve as the Herbology professor at Hogwarts. 22/33. Lavender Brown was attacked by Fenrir Greyback during the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione saved her but she was already injured. What happened to her later on was never revealed. 7/33. The Quibbler is back to publishing articles about the lunatic fringe and is appreciated for its unintentional humour. 3/33. The Resurrection Stone is now buried in the Forbidden Forest after being pressed into the ground by a centaurs hoof. It has not been re-discovered. 21/33. Hermione tells Scrimgeour that she is not planning to embark on a career in Magical Law. Ironically, thats where she ends up. She advanced the rights of magical creatures and eradicated the old pro-pure-blood laws in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, of which she is the head. 6/33. The Death Eaters Dark Marks eventually faded to look like a scar. It will no longer burn or hurt. 5/33. Viktor Krum fell in love with a woman back home in Bulgaria and presumably lived happily ever after. 14/33. In the aftermath of the war, the Order was disbanded once and for all. 23/33. Members of the DA still have their coins, as they are like badges of honor. Neville Longbottoms students were impressed when he showed them his Dumbledores Armys Coin. 20/33. Azkaban no longer uses Dementors as guardians. The number of Dementors has been greatly diminished because despair and degradation have been lessened in the world. his energies are going to be concentrated elsewhere and hes not going to have time to do that."}

Their Paint Can sprays are now available stateside in three highly pigmented shades, including Hoxton Market (a hot pink), Mayfair Lane (a pastel pink) and Shoreditch Lane (a gleaming silver). Seal your manicure with a traditional top coat and you're done! Don't worry about getting the spray-on nail polish all over your fingers -- you can remove the excess paint by simply washing your hands or using a makeup remover wipe. Next, shake up the can and spray on your nail polish. Pro tip: Place a paper towel or old newspaper to prevent getting product all over the place. And be sure to hold the bottle at least 3 to 5 inches above your hand to evenly disperse the pigment. You start by applying a base coat -- because you've got to protect your natural nails and provide a smooth surface for the pigment to adhere to. You can either use your own traditional brush-on base coat, or one that may be sold with your spray-on polish. Milk Makeup and China Glaze have recently added spray-on nail polishes to their beauty lines, proving that this trend isn't going anywhere any time soon. Some may call the spray-on nail polish trend \"lazy\" or \"messy,\" but we think it's pretty awesome.

{"pred": "Body language expert reveals nine ways to spot a liar (and how YOU can get away with telling fibs) The best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking. The mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant give-away. While she warns that there is 'no set formula' for spotting a liar, recognising some of the signs can help you root out a fibber.  'But a practised liar can easily deliver a lie while looking cool, calm and confident.  Self-comfort touches: The stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar, such as rocking, hair-stroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings. We all tend to use self-comfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing. Overcompensating: A liar will often over-perform, both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing. These over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact (often without blinking!) and over-emphatic gesticulation. Visualisation is the nearest you\u2019ll get to making the lie reality and that helps make your body language signals congruent. Heckling hands: The hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them on-message while they lie.  'A bad liar might blush and sweat and show physical signs of agitation like fidgeting,' she explained.  The face hide: When someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience. This can lead to a partial cut-off gesture like the well-know nose touch or mouth-cover. 'Forget all those claims of \"tells\" and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth.  The big pause: Lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with. First your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie.  Keep busy: If you\u2019re not very good at lying, try to keep busy when you perform the lie. Actors call this a \u2018bit of business\u2019 which is when less competent actors continue washing up or potting plants while being quizzed rather than struggling with their body language. Sip a cup of tea etc.  Now body language expert Judi James has revealed the key signs to look out for if you're concerned someone is being economical with the truth.  Micro-gestures: These are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see. Experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie.  'Despite the fact there are no \"one-size-fits-all\" symptoms to spot, the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone\u2019s not being totally honest with you.' Tell the truth first: In an emergency such as: \u2018Do you like my new hair cut?\u2019 or \u2018Am I the best lover you\u2019ve ever had?\u2019 it can help if you expel the truth first. For example, \u2018It looks terrible!\u2019 or \u2018No you\u2019re the worst!\u2019 followed by \u2018Only joking, of course you\u2019re wonderful!\u2019 When the gestures and the words are at odds it\u2019s called incongruent gesticulation and it\u2019s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth. Convince yourself first: The brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language. Don\u2019t just think of the transcript, visualise the whole story including all the smallest details. 'While I don\u2019t usually condone lying, this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth,' she said.  When we look up to our left to think we\u2019re often accessing recalled memory, but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively. Also, the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cut-off gesture, such as looking down or away. The lost breath: Bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people, meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated.  There's nothing worse than having the wool pulled over your eyes, and when it happens you often wonder how someone managed to deceive you.  Judi James is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s new Murder Mystery fundraising game Whodunnit? and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part.  The poker face: Although some people prefer to employ the poker face, many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they\u2019re being economical with the truth. It might look rude but it can be better than over-sharing in terms of your body language giveaways! The mouth dries, the body sweats more, the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter, shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard. The eye dart: Humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we\u2019re trying to hide something.  Relax: To combat the fight/flight response, breathe out slowly and deliberately to relax your muscles, especially the ones in your shoulders, arms and hands. Keep your vocal tone a little lower - lying can make us more shrill. This often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering, plus a verbal stalling technique like \u2018Why do you ask that?\u2019 rather than a direct and open response. Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s new Murder Mystery fundraising game \u2018Whodunnit?\u2019 takes place on Saturday 25th March. Gather your friends for an evening of bluffing, accusations and outrageous over-acting to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer.

Security investigators linked thefts from banks in Asia, including the $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February, to a hacking group in North Korea. The research firm Symantec has been looking into the Bangladesh bank heist, and on Thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal Bangladesh\u2019s millions was also used to hack a bank in the Philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in Vietnam last year. The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures\u2019s emails. Investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year.

{"pred": "Why It's Worth It To Get Your Flu Shot \"I also worried if everyone at work knew I got a flu shot, it'll be harder to take sick days if I do get the flu,\" says Walsh, 38. Ultimately, however, Walsh got jabbed, and experts agree it was the right call. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season. One reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. Flu shots aren't always free. Most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. But walk into your local CVS or Walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35. Insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies. As an added bonus, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that up to 36 percent of those vaccinated reduced their risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular health problems just by getting a flu shot. Based on these findings, the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people. Getting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, Jhung notes. Plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk. Only 42 percent of Americans got vaccinated in the 2011-2012 flu season, the latest data available from the CDC. What's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. Drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Typically, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for flu-related illness. Many large firms like Walsh's offer free flu shot clinics, but letting workers know they won't be penalized for taking sick leave can also pay dividends for businesses big and small. Employers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well. The CDC estimates that seasonal influenza outbreaks average $10.4 billion in direct costs due to medical treatment and hospitalizations.

His wife, however, soon sent him back in. \"I told him, 'If you get sick from the flu and can't work, you'll feel foolish over $70,'\" says Anne Delgado, 66, who is retired. \"One shot could mean food on the table for us.\" (Follow us @ReutersMoney or at http://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance; Editing by Lauren Young and Meredith Mazzilli) Flu activity usually peaks in the United States in January or February. Recent studies from the European Union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"But now is the time to get vaccinated,\" she adds. The elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu. Peter Delgado, a 66-year-old self-employed accountant, recently left a Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rite Aid before getting his flu shot. \"There was too much paperwork to fill out, and they wanted to charge me $70,\" says Delgado, who lives nearby. The high-dose version of the shot, recommended for older people, often costs more than the normal vaccine. Everyone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. \"We don't prefer one vaccine over another,\" Jhung says. \"Whatever vaccine patients choose, we're happy.\" Last winter was a big year for influenza, and it caught many patients and healthcare providers off-guard after several years of milder flu seasons. It's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the CDC, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown. The CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year. Walsh didn't get vaccinated last year and didn't get sick. The year before, she had flu-like symptoms for a week after getting the shot. Several vaccination options are available. They include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic.

{"pred": "Workaholics May Face Poor Physical And Mental Well-Being, Study Suggests Of course, it's no secret that overworking can have a negative effect on your health and happiness. A number of studies have shown the detrimental toll that work stress in particular can take on your health, including depression and an increased risk of heart attack and diabetes. And workaholism in particular has been associated with poor sleep quality, weight gain, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety, not to mention unhappy marriages and higher divorce rates. The Kansas State University study, which will be published in the journal Financial Planning Review, found that well-being is generally not a priority for workaholics. If you're addicted to checking your email and regularly work through evenings, weekends and vacations, you might be a workaholic -- and your health may be suffering because of it. Recent research has found a link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being. And with the possibility to work from anywhere, at anytime, it's easier than ever to become a workaholic in the first place. More than eight in 10 Americans are stressed about their jobs -- citing an unreasonable workload as their number-one stressor -- and 61 percent of employed vacationers will work through their vacation this year (up from 52 percent last year). \"We found workaholics -- defined by those working more than 50 hours per week -- were more likely to have reduced physical well-being, measured by skipped meals,\" doctoral researcher, Sarah Asebedo, said in a statement. \"Also, we found that workaholism was associated with reduced mental well-being as measured by a self-reported depression score.\" \"[Becker's Theory] looks at the cost of time as if it were a market good,\" Asebedo said in the statement. \"This theory suggests that the more money you make, the more likely you are to work more. If you are not engaged in work-related activities, then there is a cost to the alternative way in which time is spent. Even if you understand the negative consequences to workaholism, you may still be likely to continue working because the cost of not doing so becomes greater.\" To figure out why some choose to work overtime even when they know it's not good for health, the researchers turned to a mathematical analysis called Becker's Theory of the Allocation of Time, which helps to measure the cost of time. The theory highlights the paradox that working overtime leads to more income, but less time to spend this income. it also suggests that as income increases, workers are more likely to develop unhealthy habits around working excessively. But turning on that out-of-office autoreply and taking some time to rest and recharge can actually have a positive effect on not just your well-being, but also your productivity. Even a short nap can boost cognitive functioning, improving creative thinking, learning and memory. \"Renewal is not for slackers,\" Tony Schwartz, CEO of The Energy Project, told the Huffington Post. \"Renewal is a way in which to increase your capacity to be more effective.\" The findings are based on data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth that included 12,686 young men and women. All the study participants were interviewed each year until 1994, and are still interviewed biennially."}

Cyber detectives and some Overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by Blizzard on their videos. They are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together. A story about this was covered in detail by NeoGaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named Sombra can come to Overwatch soon. There are also speculations that Sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard. Apart from these, there has also been information that Sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to Overwatch soon. At this point we can certainly say that there\u2019s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it\u2019ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this. To start with, they pointed out to a French theater ad which suggested that Sombra will be unveiled for Overwatch soon. Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. However NeoGaf user, Nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as Blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes. Sombra has also made several appearances in various stages. She wears a metal grey helmet which is highlighted by blue, along with a gray over hood and a blue under hood. The grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with Soldier 76 and Reaper. Nirolak also mentioned about Reaper\u2019s dialogue in the game where he says, \"Where is Sombra when you need her?\", which can be another massive hint. Pointing at the second clue Nirolak wrote, \"Way back in November, people noticed that there\u2019s a table in Dorado with files for Soldier 76/Jack Morrison and Sombra. Given Soldier 76 is Jack Morrison, this only leaves the mysterious Sombra file, which would fit with a Soldier 76 vs. Sombra animated short.\" We\u2019ll update you as soon as we come across more news on this.

{"pred": "Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for. Filmmaking in 2013: \"Riddick,\" the third Vin Diesel film to feature that title anti-hero, is an indie feature. That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here? Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years. It goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move. Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo. So Universal didn't put any money into the film? Do you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made? So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada. Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie. Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed? Yes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story? Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million. So Riddick is an indie film? Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point. So, very pure filmmaking. Very pure. David Twohy, 'Riddick' Director, Explains How Hard It Was To Make A Third 'Riddick' Movie And look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too. The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him. I enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it. That's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\" Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him. They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights. Why did you want to do that? I do not. Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter."}

And the views are safe, too \u2014 the chip is less than a centimeter across.

Because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. Debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. In 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting Earth.

That\u2019s more recent than any quarterback on the Eagles roster and three years after the Eagles\u2019 most recent playoff win. The Philadelphia Eagles added another to their collection of statistically-struggling quarterbacks with the addition of Tim Tebow on Sunday. Tebow could become a zone-read specialist. Tebow\u2019s completion percentage (48 percent) ranks the lowest in the NFL over the last 10 seasons. In his NFL career, Tim Tebow has kept on 41 zone-read options for 256 yards. The only Eagles quarterback currently on the roster with any experience keeping on a zone read is Mark Sanchez, who did so six times for 38 yards last season. If signed, Tebow would join Mark Sanchez and Sam Bradford among the team\u2019s signal-callers. Overall, Tebow has rushed for 989 yards in his career. Sanchez, Bradford and Matt Barkley have combined to rush for 671 yards in their careers. Lowest Total QBR Since 2010 Tim Tebow 33.4 Geno Smith 35.7 Chad Henne 36.9 Mark Sanchez 40.4 Sam Bradford 40.7 * Minimum 30 games as QB The three each rank in the bottom five in Total QBR among those who started at least 30 games over the last five seasons. Tebow ranks lowest with a 33.4 Total QBR. Sanchez is fourth-worst (40.4) and Bradford ranks fifth from the bottom (40.7). Sanchez was off-target (over or underthrown) on a higher percentage of passes than any other qualified quarterback in the NFL over the last five seasons (22 percent), but that's only because Tim Tebow (30 percent overthrow rate) didn't rank in the top 30 in the NFL in pass attempts over that span. So why did the Eagles sign him? During his career, Tebow rushed the ball four times with his team at the one or two yard line. He scored on all four carries. All three quarterbacks tend to overthrow or underthrow their passes quite a bit. The Eagles have utilized the zone-read option a league-high 514 times the last two seasons, 235 times more than the next closest team (Seahawks). The NFL is still considering adjusting the extra point conversion at this May's owners meetings. Among the suggested proposals, the league could eliminate extra points altogether (forcing teams to go for a two-point conversion). Something else worth keeping in mind:"}

LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 A 34-year-old Lincoln man purchased a 2012 Harley-Davidson Softail Slim motorcycle this past Tuesday in an effort to cut down on his perceived duty to wave to other motorcyclists. Brandt mentioned some safety aspects that he says other riders don\u2019t consider. Safety was a big consideration in his decision to purchase the big Harley machine. \"When you ride a Harley, you just don\u2019t have to wave,\" Brandt said. \"If a guy on a Suzuki doesn\u2019t wave, you have to wonder if he didn\u2019t see you, or if he was using the clutch. Maybe he was having a bad day, but you don\u2019t want to assume that, because you really don\u2019t even know the other rider. But when you see a Harley, you know why the guy on it doesn\u2019t wave. It\u2019s because he\u2019s on a Harley. In fact, guys on the Harley machines don\u2019t even wave to riders on other Harleys!\" Brandt said the waving was the impetus for his purchase. He rode in on a 2012 Honda Shadow, which he traded in to Frontier Harley-Davidson towards the purchase price of his new motorcycle. Russell \"Rusty\" Brandt entered Frontier Harley-Davidson\u2019s front door around 11 a.m. with more than a thousand dollars in his wallet. A few hours later, he had completed the transaction, having agreed to pay $11,900 for the used motorcycle. \"The Shadow was a really good bike. Really good. I mean, I didn\u2019t even want to get rid of it, but let\u2019s get right down to the nitty-gritty. You don\u2019t have to wave if you\u2019re on a Harley. I just want to take some of the pressure off when I want to go out for a ride, and if I have to cough up some money to do that, so be it. It will be worth it.\" When asked about the inconvenience of having to trade in his motorcycle for a bike of another marque and the resulting monetary loss, Brandt was able to put things into perspective in terms of a simple cost-benefit analysis. \"It\u2019s really not that big of a deal. I wanted a new bike anyway.\" Still, Brandt remained positive about his future in motorcycling. \"Last week, I didn\u2019t wave to a guy I passed on the left. I was in the middle of shifting gears, and didn\u2019t think about it. About a mile later, I\u2019m stopped at a red light, and the guy comes up to me and starts interrogating me about why I didn\u2019t return his wave. He was really losing it. I went right home and told my wife. I told her I was trading the bike. I have a family. I can\u2019t have people I don\u2019t know coming up to me and yelling at me unannounced.\" \"I learned to ride when I lived in Creighton, and there weren\u2019t many people there. Sometimes I would see people I didn\u2019t know, and they would wave to me. I didn\u2019t even put two and two together that they were waving at me just because I was on a motorcycle,\" Brandt explained. \"It probably happened half a dozen times in two years. I moved here to Lincoln and learned that other riders wave a lot. They expect you to wave back. It\u2019s almost like a religion.\" Source: revzilla"}

Christie Mullin approached her husband multiple times about adopting the girls and bringing them back together, but the father of three had his concerns. Ivy and Lynette, both 2, have been living apart since they were 3 months old, AP reports.

The mum-of-two has enjoyed a whirlwind few weeks since creating the hilarious clip, which has seen her lavished with gifts and earnings that are estimated to total some $420,000 (\u00a3289,000). The original 'Chewbacca Mom' hysteria began when 37-year-old Candace bought the mask in a shop in Texas, and opened it up in the car park outside. Her infectious laughter, and lines including, \"I'm such a happy Chewbacca\", have made it the most-watched Facebook Live video of all time \u2013 to date it has been viewed more than 150 million times. Time magazine estimates that Candace has racked up the impressive sum predominantly through gifts she received since the video went viral in May. This includes $3,000 (\u00a32,060) from Kohls, the shop where she spontaneously bought the Chewbacca mask, a $7,500 (\u00a35,152) family holiday to Walt Disney World, and an estimated $7,500 (\u00a35,152) from her appearances on talk shows including James Corden's The Late, Late Show. The mum-of-two was also invited to join Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook HQ, where she had a meeting with the much-loved Chewbacca character from the Star Wars films. Candace told James that they only reason she had made the video was to prove to her friends and family that the mask was hers \u2013 before her children claimed it for their own. Candace has received gifts and earnings worth an estimated $420,000 The mum-of-two was recently invited to Facebook HQ By far the most valuable gift Candace has received is full college scholarships for herself, her husband and their two young children.

{"pred": "JUST IN: Bernie Sanders Makes MAJOR Announcement To His Entire Staff And Followers (QUOTES) \u2018Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump\u2019 Sources close to the Sanders campaign have reported that the Vermont Senator will begin laying off a large part of his staff starting Wednesday. The reports indicate that at least half of his staff will be laid off in the wake of Clinton\u2019s victories in New Jersey and California, though some of them might be offered jobs in Sanders\u2019 Senate office. Despite the layoffs, Sanders is not ending his campaign and is hoping to be able to sway the super delegates to his side. Sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face Donald Trump in November. It is an argument that Sanders has made throughout this primary season and it\u2019s one that the poll numbers back up. The majority of polls have Sanders defeating Trump by a larger margin than Clinton does. A spokesman for the campaign, Micheal Briggs, reiterated this plan during a statement at a Sanders rally that was held on Monday in San Francisco. A spokesman for the Sanders campaign, Briggs, has said that the senator is planning on heading back to Vermont on Wednesday, but will be back on the campaign trail by Thursday when he will head to Washington, DC. Sanders is planning on holding several rallies in Washington DC, which holds the last primary on June 14th. Sanders has a long road ahead of him if he hopes to convince the party\u2019s super delegates to back him over Clinton, as many of them have been strong supporters of her campaign since she first announced her candidacy. The Clintons have enjoyed strong support among the Democratic Party since Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1992. Whether or not Sanders can persuade the party\u2019s leadership to back him remains to be seen, but it is a long shot. The reports of the layoff came after Clinton\u2019s victory on Tuesday where she won the majority of delegates in California and New Jersey. It is important to note that despite Clinton\u2019s strong lead, she does not have enough pledged delegates to earn the nomination. She currently has 2,184 compared to Sanders 1,804. There are 158 pledged delegates still available and 2,383 are needed to win the nomination. A lot of the staff members who are being laid off are advance staff who often help with the logistics of setting up a campaign, but a lot of the field staff, who often handle phone calls and door to door campaigning, are being laid off as well. Clinton, who has been declared the party\u2019s nominee by many in the media, such as the AP, does have the support of more than 500 super delegates, which is what puts her over the top. Super delegates are party officials who can support either candidate. The super delegates will not vote until the Democratic National Convention, which will be held the last week of July."}

Given that Mr. Warhol was the world's biggest seller in 2012, we have high, high hopes. In other news, Eric Clapton might make $25 million off the sale of a Gerhard Richter painting. It may just look like a simple, retro Coca Cola advertisement -- and hey, it basically is -- but the familiar black-and-white pop piece is actually an iconic painting by the one and only Andy Warhol. And before you start thinking, \"Hey, that poster would look fantastic in my bedroom,\" you might want to check the price tag. But if you happen to catch sight of Warhol's \"Coca-Cola (3)\" -- which will be on view in London from October 12-18, don't be fooled. We're pretty sure only the wealthiest of consumers can afford this one. Warhol is probably high fiving a million angels as he contemplates the irony of his own fate. Created in 1962, the massive, human-sized canvas is heading to auction in New York City this fall, as part of Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art sale. The work had been housed in a previous collection for the past two decades, making cameo appearances at almost every Warhol retrospective in recent memory, Christie's explained in a press statement. But the stark soda masterpiece is officially up for grabs on November 12, 2013. That is, if you have $40 to $60 million sitting around. Yes, you read that right. It could set you back up to $60 million. \"What\u2019s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest,\" Andy Warhol once quipped. \"You can be watching TV and see Coca Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca Cola, too.\""}
{"pred": "Despite this, many people opt to line the seat with toilet paper \u2014 but really, this seemingly clean practice may actually be increasing your exposure to germs. Experts Warn That Lining The Toilet Seat With Paper Could Be Spreading More Bacteria But toilet paper isn\u2019t the only place where germs dwell more happily than toilet seats. When these feelings of insecurity strike, we usually reach for the nearest available seat cover and \u2014 if one isn\u2019t available \u2014 we then make one of our own out of toilet paper.  Toilet paper, unlike toilet seats, are not designed to ward off bacteria. In fact, they\u2019re sponges for it. Closing the toilet seat lid before flushing! There is a general misconception that covering toilet seats keeps you safe from germs. But toilet seats are actually designed to keep as much bacteria off of you as possible. With every flush, germs are sprayed up and out of the toilet \u2014 and often exposed right onto the toilet paper. Our skin does a great job of blocking bacteria, so trust in its ability to do its job when sitting on a dry toilet seat. Sometimes, public bathrooms are a necessary evil, especially during long car rides or when nature calls inconveniently.  If the toilet doesn\u2019t have a lid, remember that bacteria thrives in warm, wet places, so keep any surface dry, including your hands, your body, and any of the bathroom appliances. According to Today.com, germs are not easily spreadable on toilet seats, since many different bacteria and viruses don\u2019t survive long outside of a human body. We have no idea who has been in there before us, and sometimes, we just can\u2019t help but feel wary of public toilets, considering all of the crazy things that have been found in them.  Though most are pretty pristine, every once in a while, we run into some truly unsavory public bathroom situations.  Washing your hands is extremely important after you use the restroom, but drying them thoroughly and disposing of your paper towels is just as important. This lifehack may seem like a perfectly harmless, even safe, practice. But in truth, creating this protective paper barrier could be doing you way more harm than good. Studies have found that where we perceive bacteria thriving in bathrooms can be completely backwards, and what we use to keep us clean could actually be spreading the problem around! Read below to learn how bacteria is spread in all bathrooms, and what steps we should be taking to keep scary bathroom germs at bay! Though they are definitely more environmentally friendly, these dryers actually spread more germs than ordinary paper towels. In fact, a study from the the Journal of Applied Microbiology found that hand dryers were among the largest distributors of bacteria, other than flushing toilets. So what\u2019s the best way to ensure you\u2019re not spreading or picking up germs? As long as you remain aware of where bacteria is actually present, you can make smart decisions toward remaining healthy, happy, and free of more germs than are necessary! The powerful buffeting of dryers propels germs around the room and onto your hands, which can grow and increase, especially if you don\u2019t dry them completely! Their special shape and material were specifically designed to prevent bacteria from dwelling on their surface for very long."}

Every once in a while, a new story pops up that reminds us that even in their manmade homes, animals in zoos are still second-class citizens when it comes to the dangerous and unpredictable actions of humans.

{"pred": "Sextacles: How Snapchat's new Spectacles are being used in the sack SEE ALSO: People are already hacking their Snapchat Spectacles The idea was an obvious one for some Snapchat users, Rachel and Richard included. Right after the initial Spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. The idea was practically floated by Snap themselves in the marketing for Spectacles\u2014photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless. Snap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages\u2014the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have\u2014made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. And with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun. Snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex. The gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however. Just as Snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, there's bound to be  accessories for Spectacles.  Given the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy. All sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for Snap and Snapchat. That's not too surprising given that Spectacles only upload videos directly to Snapchat. A pornography section of its community guidelines states, \"Snapchat prohibits accounts that use public Stories to distribute sexually explicit content.\" \"Spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context,\" Gallop said. \"I would love to see Snap be open and active about it. you have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com/klm9kZM7B2 Snapchat Spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because A) the camera is at your eye level B) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com/QosgVH3j9e As for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using Spectacles, but one could still\u2014and isn't unlikely to\u2014show up in the near future. There's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one Spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: Spectacles as a sex toy. Richard and Jennifer saved their videos in \"My Eyes Only,\" a section of the app protected by a pin code, which Snapchat released back in July. \"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained. When Snap CEO Evan Spiegel described Spectacles\u2014his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses\u2014in a September Wall Street Journal story, he called them a \"toy.\" She credited Snapchat's \"explosive growth\"\u2014which now boasts 150 million daily active users\u2014to sexting, and though Mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app. Of the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex. Cindy Gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called MakeLoveNotPorn, said she wished Snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case. Jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows\u2014literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself. While Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story. \"The question is what appeal will these Spectacles have, if any, to this industry. Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\" Jesse Adams, co-founder and CEO of adult content app platform MiKandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of Spectacles. \"We haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there\u2019s a new gadget, we\u2019re very excited in terms of how to explore it,\" he said. There's no control or limitation to what users do with Snapchat privately, of course. The experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times. It wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious. To wit, take our friend Richard's feedback: \"The circular video part\"\u2014which is how Spectacles films footage, where users watching Spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone\u2014\"was really cool.\" How will sex tapes change after Spectacles? They don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories. Still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the Stories off of the app, deletes them from Snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder. \"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\" His company embraced the first wearable camera, Google Glass, and used it to create an app called \"Tits and Glass\" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013. \"It was the first thing I thought as we were waiting in line,\" said media entrepreneur Rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in Venice Beach with the guy she's seeing. (Names of users have been changed by Mashable at their request for privacy.) \"I'm a little skeptical about how much Snapchat can see,\" she said. Of course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed. A series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend. In fact, Spectacles owners have some recommendations. \"The glasses kept slipping off. I remember thinking at the time: I wish there was a strap,\" Richard said. \"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said. \"By turning my phone,\" he continued, \"I get a whole new vantage point.\" Of his own amateur sex footage, he means. And maybe, one day, someone else's. Rachel's not alone. Financial analyst Richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. He saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of Spectacles from the shop in New York. \"It seemed easy, and better than a phone,\" he told Mashable. \"I liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\" \"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"\u2014the color of her Spectacles\u2014\"was a bad choice,\" she said. \"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn\u2019t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said. \u2014 Gary He (@garyhe) September 24, 2016 \"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\" But you know what they say\u2014there's truth in every joke. And this one's time is coming. \u2014 Alex Micu (@axelk) September 27, 2016 Yet\u2014most of them have at least had the idea. \u2014 Damon Beres \u2728 (@dlberes) September 24, 2016 Of course, behind closed doors, it's already happened. \"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\" \"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said."}

{"pred": "It\u2019s a Long Shot, but Here\u2019s How Trump Could Win How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? He turns out white voters in historic numbers. OK, OK. \"Possible\" doesn\u2019t mean \"likely,\" and it\u2019s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney\u2019s ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it\u2019s a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won. Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t trust the models (they couldn\u2019t predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat\u2014let\u2019s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively\u2014and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn\u2019t change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.) At least, that\u2019s what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren\u2019t. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn\u2019t too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions? A terrorist attack could do it\u2014driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race\u2014but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders\u2014and immigrants in particular\u2014giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let\u2019s table this one. It\u2019s hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy\u2019s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there\u2019s a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump\u2014his proximity to the most powerful office in the world\u2014could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We\u2019re due. One is all we need for President Trump. At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. He\u2019s made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There\u2019s still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House\u2014that he\u2019s too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses. There\u2019s one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It\u2019s why the \"Never Trump\" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it\u2019s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton\u2019s biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders\u2019 backers who haven\u2019t crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it\u2019s dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won\u2019t be. It\u2019s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan\u2019s performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama. In other words, it\u2019s not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it\u2019s hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels\u201474 percent\u2014then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It\u2019s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it\u2019s possible. At the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it\u2019s possible that \"popularity\" just won\u2019t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates\u2019 worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump. With all this said, even the most probable scenario here\u2014that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates\u2014is a distant long shot. They\u2019re just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any Republican or any Democrat. And their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election\u2014partisanship, demographics, and economic performance\u2014to create favorable terrain for Democrats.

Though Ratu\u2019s baby is a great moment of hope for the Sumatran rhinos, the population is still threatened by its two biggest foes: poaching and loss of habitat. Let\u2019s hope these beautiful creatures have a bright future ahead of them! According to IRF Executive Director Dr. Susie Ellis, Sumatran rhinos are one of the fasted declining species on the planet. They were just declared extinct in the wild in Malaysia, and now exist only in Indonesia. Mama Ratu once had a reputation as the feistiest, most difficult-to-handle rhino at the sanctuary. Once she had her son, though, she calmed down and became a very attentive mother. Once you see this cute little face, you want to shower him with attention and love, too! Ratu delivered her son on a rainy day, and boy, is she a welcome sight! The beautiful Sumatran rhinos are one of the most endangered animals on the planet.

{"pred": "I can only think of two people who don\u2019t seem surprised by Trump\u2019s strong showing with Latinos. Behold, the Trump Latinos. According to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent. Trump got an astounding 44 percent. The first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics. In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened. The other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of \"Latinos for Trump.\" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates. Well, in Nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of Latino voters, we\u2019ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon\u2014one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. And, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren\u2019t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote. Why the Republican frontrunner just might be able to build on his success with Latino voters in Nevada\u2014and win the White House as a result. Now, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don\u2019t know much about Latinos. That is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: \"If these voters think like Americans, they\u2019ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won\u2019t.\" In states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation\u2019s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it\u2019s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning. The East Coast media don\u2019t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. In fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about Latinos. Next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion\u2019s share of those votes. It\u2019s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes. Meanwhile, we shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the \"Latinos for Trump\" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot. Like Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation\u2019s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they\u2019re not going to hold against him the fact that he\u2019s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he\u2019s talking about someone else. Latinos don\u2019t want to apart from America, and they aren\u2019t in conflict with America. They are the essence of America. Now, here\u2019s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States\u2014and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American\u2014is highly aspirational. They don\u2019t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don\u2019t hate Trump. They want to be Trump. But first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States\u2014whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries\u2014could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states\u2014Nevada, Colorado, and Florida. Granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That\u2019s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country. Like their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don\u2019t feel as if they must choose one over the other. Trump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers. Finally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians. It\u2019s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration\u2014especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally. For instance, they all seem to think that Latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. Not true. You may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs\" and \"bringing crime,\" and that they were \"rapists,\" criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, \"some are good people.\" Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor. And what about Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border? We know about the Reagan Democrats. In the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president. They\u2019re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They\u2019re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today\u2014particularly young DREAM\u2019ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens. Still, all those caveats and conditions don\u2019t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that. STRANGE BUT TRUE"}

While websites operated by broadcast news organizations remain ineligible, and the prize continues to be primarily focused on text, the Pulitzer Prize Board acknowledges that the web has provided new and compelling ways for journalists to integrate the written word with multimedia content. In the past, publications that identified as magazines, either in print or online, were not allowed to compete for a Pulitzer in any category. But as an increasing number of Americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense. \"Consistent with its historical focus on text-based journalism, the Board will continue to place emphasis on the enduring value of words and of serious reporting,\" the press release read, \"while also recognizing the opportunity provided by the web for integration of text with audio and visual elements to strengthen story-telling and provide information and analysis.\""}

{"pred": "More recently, researchers published a report in which they listed several reasons why drinking too much soda could potentially cause erectile dysfunction. For instance, they explain that high sugar intake could cause some of the blood vessels in the penis to become clogged up with fat, impeding blood flow and making it harder to get an erection. As such, they conclude that there is a high probability of a connection between soft drinks and soft penises, though they can\u2019t confirm this without conducting a long-term study. A number of other studies have in the past attempted to find a connection between excessive soda drinking and poor sexual health in men, though most have found no concrete proof of any link. For instance, back in the 1980s, researchers added a variety of Coca-Cola products to sperm in an attempt to see if it reduced their swimming ability, but ultimately did not find enough evidence to support this. Though there don't appear to have been any recent developments on this issue, the Internet \u2013 largely led by English tabloids \u2013 has decided that it's time to remind us all about a 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital, which found evidence that drinking too much soda can reduce a man\u2019s sperm count by as much as thirty percent. How these popular drinks produce this plunge in sperm numbers is not known, although the researchers have ruled out caffeine as the cause, after finding no connection between caffeine in other drinks and sperm count. After examining the potency of 2,500 men, the researchers discovered that those who identified as cola addicts had an average sperm count of 35 million per liter. Though this is not actually considered to be below the healthy limit, it is pretty far short of the 56 million sperm per liter that non-soda addicts were found to have swimming around their testes. Drinking too much of the black stuff could leave you with not enough of the white stuff.

{"pred": "Here's a list of 2017's biggest risks, according to WEF, Eurasia Group and Control Risks. If you thought last year was rough, just wait: 2017 promises to be a year of extreme risk. \"The fact that the country that has been the linchpin of the global order since [World War II] is no longer available for service, that is absolutely the top risk in the world today,\" added Bremmer. Weak economic growth, rising inequality, wild weather, data fraud, anti-establishment politics and forced migration are just some of the potential flashpoints highlighted by the World Economic Forum ahead of its annual meeting in Davos. The world is becoming a very scary place China - opportunity or risk? China has a lot to worry about in 2017. Trump has threatened Beijing with punishing tariffs and even questioned the U.S. position that Taiwan is part of \"one China.\" Experts say the relationship between the world's two biggest economies could change radically in 2017. \"Rapid changes of attitudes in areas such as gender, sexual orientation, race, multiculturalism, environmental protection and international cooperation have led many voters -- particularly the older and less-educated ones -- to feel left behind in their own countries,\" the WEF said in its annual risk report. And then there's Donald Trump. The president-elect is an unpredictable political force who could dramatically change U.S. priorities at home and abroad. An American retreat from the world stage is bound to cause problems for its allies. Russian disruption \"He'll hack away at the French and other upcoming European votes. And the West won't want or be able to muster a serious response -- Trump's not interested, and EU leaders are either too weak or tired of sanctions,\" Bremmer said. WEF said that while inequality between countries has been decreasing over the past 30 years, inequality within many developed nations -- including the U.S. and Britain -- has risen. The group pointed to Brexit and Trump's election as clear signs of a backlash against the status quo. In Europe, France, Germany and the Netherlands will all hold major elections in 2017. Populist and eurosceptic parties could make major gains, and further undermine the region's precarious political balance. \"Leaders in Beijing are vastly more experienced, but we have little precedent for how they may react if pushed and provoked by the U.S. on issues where China is most sensitive,\" Moran and Gilholm wrote. A reduced geopolitical role for the U.S. could further embolden Moscow to \"act as a rogue and disruptor,\" said Bremmer. An inward turn for the U.S.? Bremmer said Trump sees international cooperation in purely transactional terms: \"If there's not an obvious, near-term benefit for the U.S. ... it's not something the U.S. should be doing.\" Despite real policy differences, the two powers have avoided major conflicts in the past in order to protect their crucial trade and investment relationship. Trump's approach amounts to a rejection of \"American exceptionalism,\" the idea that the U.S. should actively promote democracy, civil rights and the rule of law around the world, according to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group. Angry voters \"As of January, when Trump takes the oath of office, the feeling is no longer mutual,\" wrote Andrew Gilholm and Michael Moran of the consultancy Control Risks. And President Vladimir Putin won't be chastened by allegations that he ordered Russian intelligence agencies to disrupt U.S. elections. The analysts said it's unclear how the relationship will play out should Trump implement the anti-China policies he promised during the campaign. Widening gaps between rich and poor, and old and young, are fueling feelings of resentment. Trump has criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense, promised to scrap free trade agreements and questioned U.S. involvement in conflicts abroad."}
{"pred": "Is 'Kanye West' More Popular Than 'Jesus Christ'? So, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close. Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since \"Jesus Walks.\" Never, though, has West's embrace of the Son of God been as fervent as his last album, \"Yeezus,\" which title is a portmanteau of West's nickname (Yeezy) and Jesus. The album also features a direct Kanye-Jesus comparison in the song \"I Am A God\": \"I know he the most high / But I am a close high.\" Only looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states). This sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, \"Jesus\" would still have more literal tweets than \"Kanye,\" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven't accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of \"Jesus\" are more popular than \"Kanye\" pretty much everywhere. With Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist. When you look at the stream of \"Jesus Christ\" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the \"Jesus Christ\" tweets are idiomatic (\"I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed\") and don't actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus's popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn't directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ's numbers are significantly smaller. Since Jesus doesn't have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn't seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\": So what happens if you compare \"Jesus\" vs \"Kanye\"? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus's 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what's going on, we see the following breakdown: There are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and 'Ye.) When did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye? But what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus. While West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year). According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper. To do this, we analyzed a year's worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison? So, it looks like Jesus is \"the most high\" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term \"Bieber\" during the same period. Kanye West's top five days: How much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for \"Jesus Christ\" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of \"Jesus Christ\" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of \"Jesus Christ\" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic \"Jesus Christ\" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions. Jesus Christ's biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was Monday. There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there's the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesu\u0300 cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus. 3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi. 4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets.

We\u2019ve all heard the same, tired cliche about infidelity: \"Once a cheater, always a cheater.\" and now science is backing it. Cheating sucks! A recent study proves that cheating is not a one-time thing, and that person will probably cheat on you again. But sadly, despite cheating, most cheaters feel belaboured when caught.  It further stated that the brain rationalises with the cheating ways, and feels less guilty, responsible when caught. How convenient, right? Each time a person is caught cheating, the response to their wrongdoing is reduced. The venerable saying is backed in this journal titled \"The brain adapts to dishonesty\".  Because some people just love to cheat and it can happen for multiple reasons - they found a better match, they just weren't loyal, the opportunity of something different, emotional incompatibility, intimacy, etc.  \"When participants were dishonest for the benefit of someone else, dishonesty at a constant rate was observed,\" the study says. When a person engages in dishonesty purely for the benefit of another it may be perceived as morally acceptable. \"We speculate that the blunted response to repeated acts of dishonesty may reflect a reduction in the emotional response to these decisions or to their affective assessment and saliency,\" the paper reads. Why do you ask? The study focused on the part of the brain called amygdala, which is the supplier of negative responses. It's a region that's associated with emotions and plays \"a key role in signalling, processing and assessing arousal.\" It further responds to an individual when they lie.  This absolute favourite thing in the world apart from murders or robbery is as evil as any other violation. We all remember happy faces, exhilaration, and sheer elation when two folks mutually get into a relationship, but half of them get thrown in predicament, simply because of infinitely.  In all this, the person on the receiving end should always be open-minded -- open to options, positivity, optimism.

Permission to use quotations from this article is granted subject to appropriate credit being given to www.arsenal.com as the source \"I believe he has a good mixture of short and long balls, in midfield it is important for us to sometimes stretch the defenders,\" Wenger said after the match. \"He is a guy who plays naturally behind the ball. He is a bit similar to Petit in the way he plays football. He likes to sit, give good long balls and be available with the centre-backs. \"He was captain at his age at Monchengladbach, that is not a small club so he has leadership qualities.\" \"He has a good engine, good stature, he is good in the air and has a good balance in his game, he has a good short ball and a good long ball. The Swiss midfielder attempted more passes, made more tackles and had more touches of the ball than any other player in the win, and also covered the most ground (11.65km). \"We have a game that is based on shorter passes than other teams so sometimes when you have a player who can kick the longer ball, it gives us a chance to get some oxygen and some space. \"He is 24 years old, he has already experience abroad and that is always a problem and is more reassuring when a player has already played abroad somewhere.

{"pred": "How Jason Statham Has Managed To Stay Ripped All These Years It seems that ever since he broke into the film industry back in 1998, starring in Guy Ritchie's cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Jason Statham has been a fucking badass. Statham ripped as fuck in Death Race. Credit: Universal Pictures Featured image credit: Jason Statham via Instagram All of that, grouped with his many action roles, most of which he performs his own stunts for, have required him to stay in great shape. But how's he maintained it for all of these years? Now, 18 years later, the 49-year-old is still ripped to fuck. Well, the 49-year-old, who has studied Wing Chun, kung fu, karate, and kickboxing, applies himself to a strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime. And by strict, I mean fucking strict; this is Jason Statham we're talking about, he's a no nonsense kind of bloke. Jason's workout plan is a different kettle of fish. The martial arts expert believes in never repeating the same workout as he feels you see more results from varying your exercises. Therefore it's hard to pinpoint a solid plan. A photo posted by Jason Statham (@jasonstatham) on Growing up, Statham was a typically sporty lad, and was actually introduced to football by none other than Vinnie Jones, his childhood friend, who'd he later act alongside. For a weight based high intensity workout, Statham's trainer will choose a combination of six exercises, set a required rep range for each individual exercise, and then repeat five times. Statham was also a keen diver in his younger years, starting when he was just 11-years-old. He went on to be a part of Britain's National Diving Squad for 12 years, and even represented England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Statham's high intensity boxing workout begins with shadow boxing, working the back and shoulder, with lunges and some quad, groin, and hamstring stretching in between to work the legs. According to BodyBuilding.com, the 49-year-old has two rules when it comes to hitting the gym: 1) \"Never repeat a workout - it is virtually impossible to go through a training plan without repeating the exercises but each and every workout would be varied. A photo posted by Jason Statham (@jasonstatham) on Jul 3, 2016 at 5:10am PDT Statham only eats 'good food', saying 95% of what he eats is clean - the other 5% being small treats every now and again. He also swears by cutting out all the sugars and heavy starch in the afternoon. If you eat carbs later in the day, it's harder to work off - if needs be, have them in the morning and your daily activities should work off the calories. The Snatch star has a specific non-iron circuit training regime, too, which requires no equipment. He told Men's Health that he picks five exercises from exploding push-ups, squat thrust, burpees, sit-ups or crunches, step-ups, tuck jumps, squat jumps, star jumps or pull-ups, and does 10 reps of each. Anyone else out of breath just thinking about this? He told BodyBuilding.com that following this warm-up, he does another 10 minutes of medium intensity exercises. This will include the likes of front squats, dead-lifts, exercises carrying kettle bells, sandbags or dumbbells, a variety of explosive medicine ball exercises, and circuit training. Eventually he was picked up by an agency called Sports Promotions which specialised in sports modelling, before he became a model for French Connection. No wonder he's fucking jacked. Whatever workout he chooses to do, he will do a five to 10 minute general warm-up, which will be him using an elliptical machine (cross fit trainer), or something else that works the whole body. 2) \"Take notes of everything - as you progress through the workouts, it is inevitable that you will get fitter, faster and stronger. Therefore, it is vital to a successful plan to record all lifts and times so that intensities can be calculated.\" He then moves onto five three minute rounds on the pads, and once that is completed, steps it up to three, three minute rounds on a heavy bag. The workout is then finished off with three rounds on the speed bag and a warm down. http://lions.gt/mechanictrailer Of the exercises, BodyBuilding.com says they include barbell front raises, dumbbell burpees, farmer's walk, pull-ups, bear crawl sled drag, close-grip pull downs, front squats, hanging knee raises, weighted step ups, and one-arm cable rows. So, unfortunately, you're not going to get as stacked as The Transporter star while chugging lagers every other day of the week, and then ending the night with a sweaty kebab. The time taken to complete the five circuits is recorded, and is how the level of intensity is measured. The times are then turned into targets so they can be used to increase the intensity of the workout as fitness levels increase. Words by Mark McGowan For lunch, he says in the interview to broaden your horizons, but fair warning, it's not going to sound too appealing. He goes on to say that the latest you should ever have your evening meal is 7pm, and it should be high in protein. He specifies chicken, fish and lean beef, accompanied by vegetables or salad. The icing on the cake, as well, is to drink a minimum of three litres of water a day; he has knocked fruit juices, full of added sugar and fructose on the head, as well as alcohol. In an interview with Men's Health, the star revealed that for breakfast he goes for either granola, fresh fruits and oats, porridge, or poached eggs.

The new attic was covered with wood paneling and painted. One man had some empty space in his attic, so he decided to fix it up into the man cave of his dreams. Instead of just making it into private space, he decided to put a twist on the room revamp. He converted it into a boat's cabin. As crazy as that sounds, it actually turned out awesome! He used this opening as the new entrance up into the attic. He modified the angle of the roof with some beams. He planned on adding a roof window that would hopefully result in some extra light. The existing opening is in the middle of the hall, which wouldn't work out. So he chipped away at a wall that was adjacent to stairs that led down into the garage. The wood of the stairs was a dark exotic grain. He enclosed the stairs in a small capsule. He switched out the door for a sliding one to save space. Then, he added a railing as a safety precaution. Time to decorate! A television, sound system, and some cool wall hangings were all necessary. This is the door, which didn't lead to anything, at first. Here's the skylight.

{"pred": "Digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger\u2019s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they\u2019re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users. Digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user\u2019s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won\u2019t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets. Getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee\u2014and no-interest\u2014savings account, is the San Francisco startup\u2019s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that\u2019s more than $35 million a month. Digit won\u2019t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago. \"If an account is labeled 'Charlie\u2019s Education Fund,' I\u2019ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it\u2019s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel. (Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.) That kind of complex analysis won\u2019t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit\u2019s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. The big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust Digit to do?\" (Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.) Late last year, just in time for Christmas shopping, Rachel Rhoads got a nice surprise. One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back. The company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit\u2019s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal\u2014or point out that the goal is unrealistic. \"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\"  A Siri for Your Finances? Digit Says Trust Me \"We want to make Digit understand more\u2014not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more\u2014related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, \u2018Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?\u2019 And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\" Behavioral finance underlies much of Digit\u2019s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money. Also on the product horizon is having Digit\u2019s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said.  Bloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit\u2019s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it. There are hitches. Since Digit isn\u2019t a bank, it can\u2019t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums. Rhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users\u2019 income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days.  Another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment\u2014every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\""}

It also includes support for the continuation of the program to send astronauts on private rockets to the International Space Station (ISS) from American soil no later than 2018. The Senate is not giving NASA money just for the sake of exploration. It is also a challenge, a mandate, actually. The bill requires that NASA make it an official goal to send crewed missions to Mars in the next 25 years. In Brief A bipartisan bill was passed by the U.S. Senate committee that oversees NASA space projects. The bill would allocate $19.5 billion in funds to NASA in 2017, but it has a critical mission for the space agency: send men to Mars. \"Fifty-five years after President Kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon, the Senate is challenging NASA to put humans on Mars.

Bill Nelson, senior Democrat on the Commerce panel. The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016 includes an overall authorization level of $19.508 billion for fiscal year 2017, but it still needs to be passed by the Senate as a whole, of course. The budget allotted is the same as what was approved by House appropriators and a bit more than the version released by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Obama administration, likewise, proposed $19 billion in funding for NASA. The bipartisan support behind the new bill shows that space exploration is an issue that all parties can agree is vital to our growth as a nation and a species. Now we just have to wait to see if it passes the Senate.

Whether Ronnie Van Zant would have liked Guns N\u2019Roses, we\u2019ll never know \u2013 but somehow, we think he\u2019d be mighty pleased to know that the legacy he helped build is positively impacting the music world and inspiring artists to stretch themselves to achieve something great! No matter where you go in the rock and roll spectrum, all roads inevitably lead to Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2013 a band as fiercely respected for their ability to get to the heart of the human condition in the form of honest lyrics wrapped around soaring melodies as they are for their innovative approach to everything from guitar playing to crafting the perfect rhythm section, their influence is felt in every facet of modern rock music. In fact, Lynyrd Skynyrd played a huge role in the success of another iconic band as they made their rise to fame; Los Angeles rockers Guns N\u2019Roses, who thanks to these Jacksonville natives, achieved critical acclaim with their smash hit \"Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine\" from 1987\u2019s Appetite For Destruction \u2013 but how? All Roads Lead To Skynyrd... According to Guns N\u2019 Roses frontman Axl Rose, \"Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine\" was directly inspired by Lynyrd Skynyrd; when crafting the song\u2019s nostalgic, strangely romantic feel, Axl turned to Jacksonville\u2019s finest for a lesson in how to write straight from the heart and make it mean not just something, but everything: \"For \u2018Sweet Child\u2019... I went out and got some old Skynyrd tapes to make sure that we\u2019d got that heartfelt feeling,\" reveals Rose. Photo credit: engadget.com"}

Assange reiterated his claims that Clinton is a \"war hawk\" that \"seemingly\" wants to start wars. The founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks added: \"Google is an intensely Washington, DC-aligned company. I see a Google exit from China... It seems much more to do with Google\u2019s feeling that it is part of \u2018family America\u2019 and that it is opposed to the Chinese.\" He also pointed out that former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is now heading the Pentagon innovation board. Fortune reported last year that researchers had found that \"Google search rankings could potentially decide the outcome of an election\". \"Of course when she is in power... she is a problem for freedom of speech. We know what she is going to do. And she made the chart for the destruction of Libya, she was involved in the process of taking the Libyan armoury and sending it to Syria.\" \"Google is heavily integrated with Washington power, at personal level and at business level. Google, which has increasing control over the distribution channels,... is intensely allying itself with the US exceptionalism. \"If Google tweaks its algorithm to show more positive search results for a candidate, the researchers say, the searcher may form a more positive opinion of him or her.\" \"It [Google] shows the will to use that at different levels. It will inevitably influence its audience.\" \"Through five experiments in two countries... biased rankings in search results can shift the opinions of undecided voters by 20% or more, sometimes even reaching as high as 80% in some demographic groups."}
{"pred": "Who Professional Gamblers Are Betting On Will Become President in 2016 So, while you may want to take the casino odds with a grain of salt, it's worth noting that betfair isn't the only online gambling site that's predicting a strong Trump showing in the primary -- with Clinton winning a narrow victory. Online gambling might only be quasi-legal in the U.S., but that's not stopping offshore sites from letting people place their bets on who will be fighting for the Oval Office in November. And oddsmakers are pretty convinced at this point that it's going to come down to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is given a 71% chance of winning the Republican nomination, says the Election Betting Odds website. (Using data from online casino betfair.com , the site averages the current \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices to come up with the implied odds.) Big bets on Clinton PaddyPower.com currently gives Trump 5/2 odds for winning the presidency. Clinton is still the frontrunner, with 8/11 odds. (Marco Rubio has 6/1 odds on that site, while Sanders is far back at 12/1.) Put in real world dollars, that means if you were to bet $100 on Clinton and she won, you'd see returns of $172.73. Take the odds for Trump and that $100 would become $350. OddsShark, meanwhile, says data from Bovada indicates you might be better served to just hold onto your money if you're considering getting some skin in the political game. The odds for Clinton winning the Democratic nomination are so overwhelming that a $100 bet would just earn you an extra $10 and that same bet on Trump to take the Republican nomination would pocket you just $25 more. Should those two face off in November? A $100 bet for Clinton today would be worth $171.43, while a Trump victory would turn $100 into $260. There is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds. One actively and methodically solicits the opinions of registered voters. The other is determined purely by gambler gut instinct. That's certainly better odds than either candidate is seeing in national political polls. An average of six polls from news organizations on Real Clear Politics shows Trump leading the Republican field with 33.2%. And among Democrats, Clinton, with 47.2% is just five points ahead of Bernie Sanders. Clinton is given an 87% chance of sealing the Democratic nomination by the site. She also is favored to win the general election by 55%. But what about the polls? Scientific? Not even remotely close. But it does show what many people perceive will be the final ballot. And perception, especially in public forums, sometimes has a sneaky way of becoming reality."}

When this old woman turns up at a boring bus stop it\u2019s not for a reason we might have thought. Prepare to have your breath taken away by her sudden and emotional display. She transforms her sidewalk performance into a beautiful recital, a recital that we would pay good money to see again in a concert hall. The world is listening, and not just listening to an \"old\" lady playing piano on the street, but listening to a musical genius. She sits down in her shabby overcoat and... starts playing the piano. However, it isn\u2019t just a bit of \u2018Chopsticks\u2019! No, indeed. This musical piece was composed by Natalie when she was just 13-years-old! Watch as her arthritic fingers glide back and forth across the black and white keys like she\u2019s a young woman again. What a beautiful performance. This isn\u2019t just a ploy to get people to cough up some coins while they wait for the bus. No, this is akin to a musical performance that people might see at the Sydney Opera House. She\u2019s been playing for a long time and knows what she\u2019s doing. Just look at how she quickly mesmerizes a group of perfect strangers! So hypnotic and beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes, BRAVO Natalie!! Thanks for posting this memorable piece of music history! If I were there, I\u2019d be giving her a standing ovation after every song. She knows she\u2019s in a place where people are ephemeral \u2013 here one moment and then boarding a bus and disappearing. She doesn\u2019t compromise her artistic integrity, though. Her performance is most important, and she won\u2019t cheapen it for anyone. Although you can see her 81-year-old hands are gnarled by arthritis, she seems to peel back at least a decade when she glides over the keys. It\u2019s as though she channels and communicates the feelings of an infinite number of souls! What an outstanding, masterful performance and to know this is a raw improvisation boggles the mind! Where is Natalie now? Recently she performed a piece called \"You Asked For Me\". This original composition was written in 1960 and played in March of 2018. Who is she and what\u2019s her name? Meet Natalie. She lives in Melbourne, Australia. She\u2019s somewhat of a local legend there. It\u2019s easy to understand why when you see how she performs. Her backstory is fascinating. The death of her two daughters led to her current situation sitting near a bus stop bench, doing what she\u2019s doing now. It\u2019s a form of catharsis. She\u2019s played at hotels all over Australia and hasn\u2019t let things keep her down. She could be a shining example to us all about perseverance. Even in life\u2019s hardships... never give up. Natalie hasn\u2019t. Bus stops are usually incredibly bland and boring. They\u2019re certainly not places you go to for entertainment! Really? Well, think again!"}

{"pred": "How A 28-Year-Old Who Retired With A $2 Million Net Worth Is Investing In 2017 In 2016, JP Livingston celebrated her 28th birthday. She also retired. Last month, I spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. JP (a pen name she goes by on her blog, TheMoneyHabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. Her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million.  With less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. Deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. When laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? In our Q&A, JP discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. This interview has been edited for brevity. Livingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs. Maya Kachroo-Levine: You've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. Can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy? Kachroo-Levine: What are your financial/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities? 2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information. More on Forbes:  Kachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them? At 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds. Many financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX). Kachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey? Secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not). People get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people. JP Livingston: My investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities. Say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished. 1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ. Kachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy? Livingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that. There are a few key arguments for this strategy. First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market. I have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago). Income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays. Kachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017? Momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion? Livingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you. Livingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know. Livingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things: Second: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability."}

According to IFLScience, the cats\u2019 fearful reactions\u2014which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable\u2014are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice.

You may have recently seen a viral video compilation of cats freaking out after they\u2019ve been ambushed by a dastardly foe: the humble garden cucumber. In these videos, the kitties are usually eating, and their owners surreptitiously sneak up behind them, place the vegetable down, and wait for their pet to turn around. Bottom line?

{"pred": "You both share story credit with J. K. Rowling. How did it work having three writers in the mix? John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, \"What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about?\" I said, \"Learning to deal with death and grief.\" There was something in her eye \u2014 I thought, we didn\u2019t say it\u2019s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we\u2019re on the right track. Thorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn\u2019t do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent. Thorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" as a starting point. Dumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that you\u2019re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. Being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. I\u2019m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. As an actor, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced before. How do you feel, Jamie and Noma, playing characters that a huge fan-base feel so possessive about? Is it intimidating? What about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can\u2019t create the kind of effects that happen in film? Callender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped. How is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel? Parker When people ask, I just pull out a wand, and go, \"I\u2019m a wizard!\" Dumezweni I think Jamie found it very intimidating. [Everyone laughs.] Tiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, \"Why not two parts?\" And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. It\u2019s a cliffhanger. Parker It\u2019s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. You have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. But you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that. Callender I\u2019m hopeful after seeing how people were about \"Star Wars.\" They mostly protected the fans. Dumezweni The weight of expectation is huge. But for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums I know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that I am playing Hermione. Ultimately it\u2019s a theater piece, I\u2019m a theater actor and doing a job as best I can. Noma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story. Jamie Parker You have abandonment issues, obviously. Was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning? Dumezweni I\u2019ve quite loved the secrecy. Although, of course, my home life is [expletive]. My daughter tries to guess what is in the play. She says, \"Just smile at me if I\u2019m right.\" Tiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas. Tiffany It will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on July 30, so that it\u2019s not our secret to keep. But if you don\u2019t read it, and you choose not to read reviews, we\u2019ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge. Tiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didn\u2019t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon. Tiffany Film has got green screen. We\u2019ve got the imagination of the audience. Thorne All right, I\u2019m a nerd. With abandonment issues. Has it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy? And what about when previews start and people are talking about the play online? Did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting? Thorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, \"This feels right, this doesn\u2019t.\" Tiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself? Parker And you don\u2019t get that much nowadays. So often things are ruined because you know so much. Friedman That\u2019s enough! Tiffany My mum is the only problem. Everyone else is fine. She asks really specific questions; then I discovered people are quizzing her in her local supermarket."}
{"pred": "What is the Easiest Way to Quit Smoking? Researchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey. How Hypnotherapy Helps You Quit So what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable \u0096 or unnecessary \u0096 to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market. A comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone. The real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an \u0093automatic\u0094 behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on. Smoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days. What does Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and Ellen DeGeneras all have in common? They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits. But going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn.

Given Leonard's penchant for writing about criminals and their hijinks, we expected something a bit more dark and dangerous than these golden hues and comfortable vintage furnishings. When famed crime novelist Elmore Leonard passed away in July at the age of 87, readers and moviegoers alike mourned the author of titles like \"3:10 To Yuma,\" \"Get Shorty,\" and \"Rum Punch\" (later filmed by Quentin Tarantino as \"Jackie Brown). \"His jeans are all lined up, his shoes are all perfect,\" Hall & Hunter Realty Listing Agent Lanie Hardy said of the storage space in the sprawling master suite. \"I've never seen a closet so organized.\" The home offers an insight into Leonard's mind, she thinks: fun-loving, yet meticulous and methodical. \"I like it,\" Leonard once said of metro Detroit. \"Great music ... lot of poverty. I wouldn't move anywhere else.\" The Leonard family bought the 1940 estate outside of Detroit 22 years ago. But one doesn't have to be literary to be impressed by the house's amenities. Speaking of that pool? As the story goes, Aerosmith once came over and swam in it. Located at 2192 Yarmouth Rd. and listed through Hall & Hunter Realty of Birmingham, Mich., the home is a French Regency stunner with five bedrooms, four full baths and three half baths. Set on over an acre, the graceful 4,733 square foot mansion is part of a secluded little suburban escape with its own private pool and tennis court. The listing notes that the \"floor plan [was] created for a lifestyle that included live-in help and formal entertaining,\" if the four-room owner's suite or two-story foyer with an Art Deco banister wasn't a tip-off."}

The caribbean destination was once home to 12,000 people before a dormant volcano spewed up to 20-feet of ash over the capital in 1995, forcing two-thirds of its residents to flee. No one was injured and a few residents returned to their homes on the island, but another eruption in 1997 killed 19 people. Today, half of the island is abandoned and some of the buildings are still partially buried. The island's airport reopened in 2005 after it was destroyed a decade earlier, and the still-active volcano and ruined town have turned into quite the tourist destination.

Two inmates took justice into their own hands and brutally attacked the woman in a stairwell that was absent of video surveillance. While ten other inmates watched, the two women went to working beating Smith, using a homemade knife to stab her and punch her numerous times. While Smith howled in pain, the others watched for four minutes as the attack continued, resulting in a cut across her cheek that was an inch in length. Staff at the Folson Prison all agree that they don\u2019t feel bad for the murderer and she deserved what she got. \"What goes around comes around,\" said staffers regarding the karmic incident. Some justice has been served for twenty-three year old prisoner Kathryn Smith.

{"pred": "Guess How Much Money Bill Gross Made Last Year? Gross\u2019s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined. So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor). In the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross. But while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door. We can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let\u2019s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year. And the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny. The top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors. In the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco's revenue is a \"material\" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations. Part of the reason for Gross's longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the \"Pimco Premium.\" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts. Much of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco\u2019s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm\u2019s revenue. However, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined. How Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk. The bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz\u2019 partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross\u2019s financial and managerial judgment. Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion. When Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion. For one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money. In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually. Why? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.) Thus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest. This same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn't already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was \"the tail wagging the dog.\" How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street. Pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs. In a recent Allianz presentation following Gross' departure from Pimco, the firm's new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, \"We don't comment on matters of compensation.\" * * * * * * A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\" Pimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays. If I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings. Perhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets. Beyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management. Another item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive. It has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer\u2019s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market. The market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now."}
{"pred": "Facebook could be your next landlord. In an effort to drum up support for the controversial expansion of its headquarters, the social media giant is trying to give back to the community by building at least 1,500 housing units that can be rented by the general public\u2014not just Facebook employees. This isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either. In 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare. Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 1.1 million square feet. The proposal is still missing some important details, though. For starters, it\u2019s still unclear if Facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party. Secondly, it\u2019s also unclear what the timeline for the development is. Despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: Facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it\u2019s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can\u2019t afford the rent. But there\u2019s a catch. As Facebook slowly wades into the real estate development business, the company is pushing an aggressive PR agenda to convince people that Facebook does not exacerbate income inequality in areas where it develops real estate. Facebook has pledged that 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families. Which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros. That\u2019s exactly what happened when Facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the Menlo Park area, where its headquarters is located. Most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t win Mark Zuckerberg many new friends in the area. Is Facebook turning Menlo Park into a 21st century version of Pullman? It\u2019s too soon to tell. The new office expansion is slated service at least 6,500 new employees and offering housing to the general public to offset crowding concerns is certainly a gesture on Facebook\u2019s part. But while some poor people will get homes in the new real estate development, it\u2019s surely won\u2019t be enough to fix the area\u2019s greater socioeconomic problems. Facebook has been embroiled in a fiery debate about income inequality for years. This January, the World Bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it. \"Some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks,\" the report said. \"Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality\u2014in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.\" At the time, a Wall Street Journal report referred to the project as being similar to a \"company town,\" the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers. The employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches. Towns like Pullman, Illinois were created as \"capitalist utopias.\" But ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents. [Wall Street Journal] Sponsored Image: Getty"}

Just look at 2016: Atlanta, The People v OJ, Veep, The Night Of, Stranger Things, Westworld... the list of brilliant TV shows goes on.  Among those six new episodes, though, lies \u2018San Junipero', a somewhat enigma when it comes to the series. Instead of telling a morbid, freighting tale about a dystopian future, creator - and the episode\u2019s writer - Charlie Brooker decided to tell the wonderful love story of two women. **Spoilers ahead** Many of the best - including the likes of Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, and The Walking Dead - took viewers down dark, emotional roads. The latter show, for instance, saw numerous popular characters killed off. The former saw an animated horse\u2019s continued existential crises hit a new low. House of Cards offered another petrifying take on the political climate. Well, there\u2019s one issue.

A reminder, that everything could be flicked off with the switch of a button/power outage. A haunting reminder to live every moment to the fullest. One show many consider to have a doom-mongering, pessimistic view of life is Black Mirror, the Channel 4 show picked up by Netflix. Season three offered some of the darkest episodes yet: just look at \"Shut Up and Dance\", centring on a young man being blackmailed into doing terrible tasks for a group of hackers, featuring a horrendous final twist. Written down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death. Yet, what transpires is a heartfelt tale of two women who decide, in spite of everything, to be together, their love overwhelming rational thinking. Is there really anything more life affirming than a love story where love reigns triumphant? In the episode, the wonderfully awkward Yorkie - played by Mackenzie Davis - falls helplessly in love with Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) while partying at the Californian beach resort San Junipero. This is no ordinary love story, though, as the pair mysteriously meet each other in different time periods over a number of weekends. How? Because San Junipero isn\u2019t a real place: it\u2019s a realistic virtual reality; a place the consciousness is uploaded to rather than physically visited.  Eventually, after overcoming some reticent feelings, the pair meet up in real life and marry so Kelly can formerly authorise Yorkie\u2019s euthanasia, putting her out of her pain. Yorkie is then uploaded to San Junipero. Kelly, however, rejects Yorkie\u2019s advances to also fully upload her consciousness to San Junipero once she dies because of a promise to her previous husband. After months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, Kelly decides to upload her consciousness to San Junipero, living out her days with Yorkie. It transpires that Yorkie - despite appearing to be in her 20s in San Junipero - is actually an elderly, paralysed woman, living in an assisted living facility with only six months left. Kelly, meanwhile, is actually based in a separate retirement home, seeing out her days in San Junipero. "}

Upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey. By the time I arrived in Calicut, at the house where I had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral. Someone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood. I made myself another two more. It takes a seismic event to get a transglobal family together in one place. For mine, it was the death of my grandmother in Kerala. Following the funeral, my aunt, who had travelled from America, asked me to take a walk with her. The oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home. Feeling slightly light-headed, I was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye. On the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that I had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up. Back on the side of the road in Calicut, I looked at Padmanabhan's boarded-up shop and back towards my aunt. She smiled, and took my hand, like she had when I was a child, to walk me back to the house. \"Indian society frowns upon IV drug use and extramarital sex, but happily encourages unhealthy food and promotes inactivity (cars, escalators, remote control for TV).\" He'd cut and shaped my aunt's wedding sari. And my cousin's. He'd made my school uniform. And my niece's and nephew's. He'd disapprovingly made me my first pair of skinny jeans, and pretended not to smile when I told him that people had asked if they were from Paris. It had belonged to a tailor named Padmanabhan. He had, with his sole sewing machine and thick robust fingers, been the architect of many of my family's fashion choices over the years. Following our interview, Dr Kalra contacted me via Whatsapp to offer a few extra facts. \"Of what, he was only in his 50s, wasn't he?\" I asked, not particularly surprised that the news of our local tailor had reached her in Kansas. \"He died,\" my aunt said, following my gaze. She had been our collective anchor. My grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. And everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar. And as my aunt and I took our walk, we passed several street vendors. A man was pulping sugar canes into a drink. Did I know that 11 January 2017 marks 95 years since the first insulin injection was administered in Toronto? And urbanisation and stress leads to the disease, although it doesn't discriminate between classes or socioeconomic backgrounds. Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high. During the 13th Century, Calicut became a major port for the Indian Ocean trade route. Merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the West. Calicut, where I was born, is a city on India's south-west coast. I often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest. There's significantly less traffic than in many other cities in India. Coconut trees line the streets, as the Arabian Sea sparkles to the west and the Wayanad hills rise in the east. And could I please remind our readers that reducing sugar and engaging in physical activity like yoga or something fun, like Punjabi folk dancing or bhangra, will go a long way towards reducing the condition. At December's Global Diabetes Summit in Berlin, doctors described Type 2 diabetes as \"scarier than HIV and malaria,\" causing more deaths than either. But is society enabling the deadly killer? \"Type 2 diabetes. He had to have his leg amputated. So sad.\" Type 2 Diabetes India has, until it was surpassed by China, been called the diabetes capital of the world, with an estimated 50 million people having Type 2 diabetes. And worryingly, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), that figure will only get worse - to an estimated 87 million people with the disease in the country by 2030. 'We need to understand and address the psychosocial domain of diabetes - not just the biomedical facts,\" Dr Kalra told me. \"HIV is caused by relatively few high risk behaviours. For diabetes, high risk behaviours impact every sphere of life. The international burden of diabetes is a much-told news story. New data from the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million people in the world have diabetes. By 2040, the figure is expected to grow to 642 million. That's an estimated one in 10 of the world population. Currently as much as 12% of total health expenditure goes on treating the disease."}

She boiled Charmin brand toilet paper in a pot on her stove and mixed it with glue to create the dress. This is the kind of thing you have to see to believe. We have to agree that if she can create a wedding dress this beautiful out of toilet paper she could certainly do something even more amazing out of actual fabric. But, today's story is about toilet paper. It doesn't really seem like the kind of material (can we even call it material?) that would be used for making clothing; however, one woman actually made a wedding dress out of toilet paper. Sure, toilet paper is white, but a wedding dress and toilet paper usually don't belong in the same sentence. Amber Mills, a veteran Marine, is used to challenges. First of all, she was a Marine. Second of all, she has multiple sclerosis. She's also a mom. Another comment reads, \"Wow! That's the prettiest Wedding dress ever! She should have gotten First place! So creative! I Pray God Blesses her with orders for Wedding Dresses! They will be one of a kind for sure! And absolutely Beautiful!\" Another example of a beautiful and unique dress is one that a teenager hand-painted and wore to her high school graduation party. The result was simply spectacular. Many people are impressed with Mills' dress and are even feeling inspired to do something creative themselves. One person wrote, \"God Bless You! I love your video Amber! You're so inspirational! You've jump started my dormant fashion designer in me! I love this video!\" Then there's the story of a boyfriend who taught himself to sew so that he could make a prom dress for his date. That's love. In his case, it actually led to paying gigs! We've seen a lot of beautiful dresses, and it's always interesting to see dresses made in unusual ways. For example, one elementary school art teacher had her students decorate her dress with their own artwork. The result was whimsical and beautiful, but we don't know that we would have been brave enough to let our elementary aged children decorate our clothing."}

Looks like Gomez's hotness rating is on the up and up! Selena Gomez is a total 10, but when she's asked to rate herself, the \"Good For You\" singer is pretty humble.

It\u2019s OK that marriage is hard and sucky sometimes. You will be OK. Your marriage will be OK. But here\u2019s something else no one might have told you: It\u2019s OK that marriage is hard. Because here\u2019s the thing that no one tells you: Marriage is fucking hard. It will suck sometimes. Because even with the fighting and the anger and the difficult times, marriage is pretty fucking great. The truth is, some of the most amazing things in life\u2014marriage and parenting among them\u2014are really hard work. Marriage is not all heart-shaped rainbows and diamonds made from unicorn poop. Marriage is not skipping in the park together before having porn star sex in the middle of the afternoon. And marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on Facebook with words like \"soul mates\" and \"#soblessed.\" Marriage is hard work, and there will be difficult times now and then. Because when you share your freaking life with someone else\u2014raising a family and building careers, paying taxes and choosing Netflix shows\u2014it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then. So fear not, you are not alone. Marriage is hard for everyone now and then. And making it through those sucky stretches might even make your marriage better. Because even though marriage has its hard and shitty days, marriage is also knowing you have someone on your side who will hold an umbrella over you when the shit hits the fan. They told you marriage would change over time, that there would be hard times, but they never said it would be like this. Well, I can assure you that they have. We all have. Sure, our \"hard times\" all look different\u2014because each marriage is different\u2014but I assure you that we\u2019ve all been through our own rocky stretches on the path to marital bliss. And not the romantic hypothetical hard times that you imagined before you had kids, the kind that involve short fights followed by steamy make-up sex. No. Marriage is really fucking hard sometimes. Whatever the case, your marriage feels hard and heavy right now . And you find yourself singing Coldplay lyrics on repeat. No one ever said it would be easy, but\u2014dammit\u2014no one ever said it would be this freaking hard either. Everywhere you look, you see hap-hap-happy couples. You see the smiling picture perfect family photos on Facebook and think to yourself, I bet they don\u2019t fight about what kind of cereal to buy. You see other parents and wonder if they were up until 2 a.m. bickering about whose turn it was to get up with the baby. You see cute couples at the park on the weekend, pushing their toddlers in the swings, and doubt they have ever gone through the low-grade suckiness that you\u2019re in right now. You will fight about big things and little things and things you don\u2019t even care about. You will fight about whether to shop at Walmart or Costco, about whether your son needs a haircut, and whether your Aunt Josie is a racist or just an idiot. You will argue late into the night about whether to sign your daughter up for dance lessons or the soccer team. You will have drop-down, drag-out brawls about whether the toilet seat should be left up or down. And you will give each other the silent treatment for two days after one of you suggests that your mother might be a little \"needy.\" But you will get through it. You will remember that you\u2019re on the same team. You will fight, and then you will forgive. You will compromise. You will get therapy if you need to. You will take a deep breath, flip each other off, and then laugh at yourselves. You might be exhausted and lonely, or feeling a little neglected lately. Maybe you had a fight last night and the night before that and the night before that. Maybe you\u2019re feeling a little PMS-y and angry about the dishes that never get put in the dishwasher, and for the love of all things holy, would it be that hard to change the toilet paper roll. Maybe you\u2019re in a little rough patch, snapping at each other about leaving the fridge door open and forgetting to change the burned-out lightbulb in the bathroom. There will be fights. You will tally up who slept less and who worked longer hours. You will keep track of who changed the last diaper and whose turn it is to control the remote. You measure who spends more hours chauffeuring the kids to soccer practice and ballet lessons, and who spends more hours working in a dead-end job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. You will keep score of the number of socks on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, and toilet paper rolls unchanged. There will be anger. Or maybe you\u2019re dealing with some really fucking brutal shit. Let\u2019s cut to the chase, shall we? In fact, you might scare yourself with the depth of blind rage that you feel when you see his socks on the floor or hear her loud chewing. You might want to smother him with a pillow when he snores blissfully as you get up in the middle of the night\u2014again!\u2014to feed the baby, get the toddler a drink of water, or calm the big kid after a scary dream. You might nearly lose your fucking mind when she runs out of gas\u2014again!\u2014and you need to leave a work meeting early and drive 60 minutes round-trip to pick her up.

Even Americans lucky enough to have paid time off are foregoing valuable vacation days to spend more time at the office, a national Bankrate survey of 1,000 employees shows. Some 52% of Americans say they won't be using all of their paid time off this year. They're often leaving seven days or more on the table, especially in regions like the South and the Midwest. The other reasons given confirm that many U.S. workers feel bound to their jobs. The good news is that the top reason workers claimed they did not use all of their vacation days in 2016 was because they were saving them to use in 2017. \"Without taking time to recharge, employees can find themselves stressed, overworked and sick \u2014 all of which have a direct impact on their work performance,\" says Sarah Berger, personal finance expert and \"The Cashlorette\" at Bankrate.com. Is America's culture of \"workaholism\" to blame? Partly, the survey shows. About a third of respondents said that they plan on taking advantage of the fact that their company lets them roll over unused days. (Though, who knows? They may have said that last year too.) So consider taking your vacation, even if you just recharge at home. But if you can't, and would still like a way to de-stress in your off hours, consider taking up a hobby.

In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them \u2014 2007 \u2014 did the index drop in the fourth. Actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. In these 19 years, the S&P's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data. But for the bullish strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. Lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly \u2014 creating an additional bullish force in the market. The fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes. That 74 percent \"win rate\" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the S&P over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain. However, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain. The recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality \u2014 or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness. After three winning quarters for the market, what will the fourth bring? So will the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, continue the bullish trend?

Saving money can often mean cutting back on things you love - but these expert tips prove that doesn't need to be the case. 'There's no magic to it we've picked out some secrets to help people buy better.  With smart shopping, those pounds can quickly add up to savings of thousands over the course of a year.'  Money expert Cathal Wogan, from Quidco, said: 'Many of us want to be able to count our savings in pounds rather than pennies but don't know where to start. In-store offers can help you save on your weekly shop, but your receipts could help you save hundreds of pounds too. On top of discounts, there is a cashback deal to be found on nearly everything we buy online. If you shop through Quidco you can commonly get 5 per cent, 10 per cent or more in cashback on whatever you buy. With average annual savings of \u00a3305, it's a money-saving habit worth picking up.  START A SAVINGS ACCOUNT   Apps such as ClickSnap feature grocery discounts and even freebies. It works by refunding the cost of certain goods after you upload a picture of your receipt, with dozens of different promotional offers every week. Here, FEMAIL rounds up the seven best tips...  This is especially true with big-name chains like phone shops, and homewares and electricals outlets, where flexible discounting can often be part of their retail policies.    Starting a savings account can fall down the list of priorities for many of us because the returns might not immediately be huge. But very few people know how to get big cash bonuses when they start a savings account. CHECK FOR A CASHBACK DEAL    'You can do this with non-perishable food goods, but also other items like cleaning and personal hygiene products, which are regularly heavily discounted. Just make sure to do the maths.'  Buying more will therefore increase your savings in the long term as you use your discounted purchases even when that item goes back to its standard price. If you see a good deal on something you'll use, it's often cost-effective to stockpile.   It might sound too good to be true, but you would be surprised how often you can get a discount if you just ask.  BUY CLOTHES OUT OF SEASON   ASK FOR DISCOUNTS   Cathal explained: 'Take for example a family using two \u00a31 tins of tomatoes in a big weekly pasta dish. That's \u00a3104 of tinned tomatoes, so stockpiling those tins when they're available at half price could put \u00a352 back into the family finances every year.  If you can train yourself to think ahead to summer wear in the autumn, you'll see that the clearance sale prices can leave you with money in your pocket. From stockpiling discounted goods to buying coats in summer, some of the handy hints focus on savvier shopping habits.Others are as straightforward as asking big brands for a better deal. It might be hard to think of winter in spring, but planning ahead seasonally can help you save a bundle on clothes and shoes.  A \u00a3100 winter coat could be down to \u00a350 in spring as retailers clear stock, so thinking ahead to what you'll need in nine months time will reap major rewards.  Companies love when the people who enjoy their products tell them about it.  If you just send a letter to the freepost address of the manufacturer, they will often send you goodies or vouchers to say thank you. The same goes for advocating for your favourite products and services on social media, as it's not unusual for them to get back to you to say thanks with some freebies.

{"pred": "Rio Olympics Ratings Are the Worst They\u2019ve Been in Years Critics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC \u2019s early coverage of the Rio Olympics \u2014 and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock\u2019s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It\u2019s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday\u2019s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor. The first sign of trouble for NBC \u2019s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday\u2019s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that\u2019s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer\u2019s No. 1 series, NBC \u2019s America\u2019s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the London games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. (The runner-up? Athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) Worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of NBC \u2019s Sunday Night Football last fall (12.9) rating. It\u2019s also far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster. NBC \u2019s Olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the U.S. team is doing at any given time, and Sunday\u2019s stellar swimming performances by Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps \u2014 telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to American audiences \u2014 delivered a massive Nielsen boost for NBC . Early numbers show the network\u2019s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since Athens 2004 that a night three of the Olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. What\u2019s more, while viewership was still down compared to London, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both Athens and Sydney. If Team USA can keep winning, NBC still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the Games. Things didn\u2019t improve much on Saturday, the first night of competition: NBC averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from London\u2019s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. Part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by NBC \u2019s non-stop commercial breaks. Final numbers aren\u2019t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like Friday\u2019s opening was down around 43 percent compared to London (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). Perhaps some of that audience shifted to NBC \u2019s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network\u2019s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won\u2019t be of much comfort to Peacock accountants. Still, expect NBC to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called \"total audience\" measurement data later this week. Michael Phelps. Photo: Adam Pretty"}

{"pred": "Americans Approve Of Obama's Call With Iran's Hassan Rouhani, But Skepticism Remains: Poll The poll found that 48 percent of Americans approve of Obama speaking on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, while 31 percent said they disapprove (another 21 percent weren't sure). The vast majority of Democrats approved of both Obama's approach to Iran as a whole and of his phone call with Rouhani, while the vast majority of Republicans disapproved. But independents disapproved of Obama's Iran approach, 52 percent to 26 percent, while a plurality approved of the conversation with Rouhani, 42 percent to 33 percent. And although more approved than disapproved of Obama's phone conversation with Rouhani, outlook on Obama's handling of Iran was more bleak. Thirty-six percent said that they approved of Obama's handling of issues with Iran, while 46 percent said that they disapproved. Few said that they had heard much about the conversation between Obama and Rouhani. Twenty-four percent of respondents said they had heard a lot, 48 percent that they had heard a little and 28 percent had heard nothing at all. Americans are more likely to approve than disapprove of President Barack Obama's recent phone call with the president of Iran, but only a third think more open communications would improve relations between Iran and the U.S., according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll released Thursday. Obama's phone conversation with Rouhani on Sept. 27 was the first time since 1979 that leaders from the two countries had spoken. The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 30-Oct. 1 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance. The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. The poll found that most still consider Iran to be unfriendly to the United States, including 43 percent who said it is an enemy and 33 percent who said that it is unfriendly. A total of only 6 percent said that Iran was either an ally or at least friendly to the United States. Still, that outlook reflected an improvement over a YouGov poll conducted in mid-September, when 51 percent described Iran as an enemy. But respondents were skeptical that more open communications with Iran would make much difference to the relationship between the two countries. Thirty-six percent of respondents said that the relationship would be improved by more communication, while 34 percent said that it would make no difference. Another 10 percent said it would actually make things worse."}

But this modest herb could make cows\u2019 methane-heavy belches \u2014 a big contributor to the warming of our planet \u2014 a little less potent. NPR points out that oregano oil isn\u2019t the only solution to cutting down cows\u2019 ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows\u2019 methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk. Oregano\u2019s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow\u2019s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano\u2019s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows\u2019 methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast."}
{"pred": "Informally, Russia has long marked St. Patrick's Day, joining the rest of the world in the March 17 celebration of Irish culture that includes lots of green and lots of drinking. This year, however, the Russian Orthodox Church is doing something different. Despite this, the divide between the two wings of Christianity means that the Russian Orthodox Church will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day along with the rest of the world. While the Catholic Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the older Julian calendar. The two calendars are about two weeks out of sync. For members of the Orthodox faith, celebrating two St. Patrick's days may not be an option: March 17 falls in the middle of the Orthodox observance of Lent, when many religious Russians abstain from alcohol. Father Igor Fomin, head of a church at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, told Tass news agency that getting drunk in honor of a saint is like being heavily intoxicated at your mother\u2019s gravesite. The March 30 date seems likely to extend Russia's St. Patrick's Day festivities rather than replace them. Russia has held events celebrating the day since the fall of communism. More than 15,000 people are expected to attend this year's official parade in Moscow, which will take place on March 18; the parade itself is part of a larger spread of events related to Ireland that take place March 15 to 26. This means that the day of St. Patrick's death \u2014 March 17 in the Gregorian calendar \u2014 falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church. Earlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of Saint Patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of Ireland. Orthodox leaders told the Russian media they hoped that recognizing Saint Patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of Christianity, before the Schism of 1054 that divided the faith into East and West. \"I am very happy that our St. Patrick\u2019s Day falls on a different date, that way the traditions associated with it, that are strictly cultural and not religious can be ignored,\" Fomin said. It's formally celebrating St. Patrick's Day for the first time \u2014 but on March 30. In a statement given to the Govorit Moskva radio station, the Irish government said it was glad the Russian Orthodox Church had made the decision. \"We hope to see our friends in Moscow on all of our Irish events in the next two weeks,\" said Arthur Hendrick, consul at the Irish Embassy in Moscow."}
{"pred": "Why Brock Turner is not actually a rapist Under English law, Turner wouldn\u2019t be classified as a rapist either. As in California, the offence of rape is strictly confined to a man penetrating another person with his penis in the absence of consent. That is why a woman cannot be convicted of rape except in circumstances where she assists a man to commit the crime. Brock Turner\u2019s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined \u2013 and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing \u2013 out into the open. The tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman. Around the world outraged headlines have referred to the \"Brock Turner rape case\". And that\u2019s quite accurate \u2013 he was originally charged with rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person. But those indictments were dropped at a preliminary hearing, reportedly after prosecutors received the results of DNA testing. As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone\u2019s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class. As such, the case continued on the basis of \u2018lesser\u2019 charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person; penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. In essence, Californian state law defines rape as penetration by the penis. Since that did not occur Turner is a criminal, a sex offender \u2013 but he isn\u2019t, according to the law, a rapist. There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student Brock Turner , following his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. A compelling, haunting description by the victim of her experience has been read millions of times online after being released by the district attorney \u2013 its power so at odds with the court\u2019s apparent leniency. Even so, Turner\u2019s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison. Even putting aside the precise definition of his conviction, it is no wonder that his six month sentence has received such criticism. Unfortunately, after reading the defendant\u2019s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can\u2019t even see that distinction. So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so. I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn\u2019t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don\u2019t line up, she\u2019s out of her mind, she\u2019s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he\u2019s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he\u2019s having a really hard time right now. Whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course. It is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded. We have \u2013 for the most part \u2013 moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of \u2018phallo-centric\u2019 rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed. Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don\u2019t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There\u2019s your first powerpoint slide. I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer\u2019s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing. The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better. My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice. It is notable that America\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigations defines rape differently, as \"penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim\". That reflects the trend in state laws, although there remains considerable variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness. California is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise \u2018object penetration\u2019 to a lesser degree than penile penetration. At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he\u2019s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that\u2019ve happened. Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person. Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer\u2019s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks. The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me. When I was told to be prepared in case we didn\u2019t win, I said, I can\u2019t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don\u2019t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That\u2019s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn\u2019t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing. \ue807 LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code: \ue808 Restart \u2018Heroic\u2019 Swedish student who stopped Stanford rape describes what he saw \ue607 Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life \ue612 \ue611 I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn\u2019t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don\u2019t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation. \ue607 19 show all \ue603 \ue607 Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life Even in this story, there\u2019s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn\u2019t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we \"met\", I\u2019m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn\u2019t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can\u2019t do that, then no. Don\u2019t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency. You said, During the trial I didn\u2019t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case. Speak out against campus drinking culture. That\u2019s what we\u2019re speaking out against? You think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less. You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to \"speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.\" Read the Stanford victim's full impact statement Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this. See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was \"unconscious intoxicated woman\", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something. Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That\u2019s the difference. I thought there\u2019s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He\u2019s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused. The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney\u2019s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself. I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said \"Rape Victim\" and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it\u2019s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions. I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don\u2019t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn\u2019t real. I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct. Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you\u2019d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn\u2019t [you] say, \"Stop! Everything\u2019s okay, go ask her, she\u2019s right over there, she\u2019ll tell you.\" I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn\u2019t speak because of what he\u2019d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn\u2019t make sense. According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don\u2019t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that\u2019s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her. He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn\u2019t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn\u2019t expire, doesn\u2019t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it\u2019s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life. 18/19 Sri Lanka Recommendation: I call upon the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of sexual violence, including against national armed and security forces, and to provide multisectoral services for survivors, including reparations and economic empowerment programmes for women at risk, including war widows and female heads of household \ue804 tumblr Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don\u2019t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you\u2019re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn\u2019t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, \"At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.\" Here\u2019s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn\u2019t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn\u2019t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me? You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that\u2019s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that\u2019s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement. If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I\u2019m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don\u2019t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused. And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn\u2019t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn\u2019t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember. You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be. Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney\u2019s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn\u2019t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like: One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don\u2019t remember, so how do I prove I didn\u2019t like it. The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub. The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant\u2019s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. 3/19 Colombia Recommendation: I commend the Government of Colombia for the progress made to date and its collaboration with the United Nations, including through the visit of my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict in March 2015. I encourage the authorities to implement Law 1719 and continue to prosecute cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict to ensure that survivors receive justice and receive reparations. Conflict-related sexual violence should continue to be addressed in the Havana peace talks, as well as in the resulting accords and transitional justice mechanisms. Particular attention should be paid to groups that face additional barriers to justice such as ethnic minorities, women in rural areas, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and women abused within the ranks of armed groups. I encourage the Government to scale up its protection measures and share its good practices with other conflict-affected countries To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense. 16/19 Liberia Recommendation: I call on the Government of Liberia to continue its critical efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence including through the United Nations-Government of Liberia Joint Programme, and in the context of recovery from the Ebola virus epidemic My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that\u2019s what happens when you finger someone, and he\u2019s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I\u2019m silly and that\u2019s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me. This can\u2019t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings. One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That\u2019s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn\u2019t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don\u2019t even know this person. I still don\u2019t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can\u2019t be me. 7/19 Mali Recommendation: I urge the Government of Mali, with support from United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, to develop a comprehensive national strategy to combat sexual and gender-based violence and to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers so that services can reach remote areas. I further call on all parties to ensure that conflict-related sexual violence is addressed in the inter-Malian dialogue and that perpetrators of sexual violence do not benefit from amnesty or early release \ue612 \ue611 1/19 Afghanistan Recommendation: I urge the Government of Afghanistan to adopt legislative reforms to ensure that sexual violence offences are not conflated with adultery or \"morality crimes\" and to establish infrastructure for the delivery of protection, health and le gal services to survivors. I call on the Ministry of the Interior to accelerate efforts to integrate women into the Afghan National Police, thereby enhancing its outreach and its capacity to address sexual and gender-based violence If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly. 8/19 Myanmar Recommendation: I urge the Government of Myanmar to continue with its reform agenda and, in the process, take practical and timely actions to protect and support survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and to ensure that security personnel accused of such crimes are prosecuted. Sexual violence should be an element in all ceasefire and peace negotiations, excluded from the scope of amnesty provisions and addressed in transitional justice processes. It is critical that women be able to participate consistently in and influence these processes Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words. Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on. You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong. Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life. 6/19 Libya Recommendation: I urge the national authorities in Libya to implement Decree No. 119 and Resolution 904 of 2014 to ensure redress for all victims, including those affected by the current conflict, through the establishment of multisectoral services and the adoption of legislation to categorically prohibit sexual violence He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He\u2019d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don\u2019t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there\u2019s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He\u2019s in the clear. The night after it happened, he said he didn\u2019t know my name, said he wouldn\u2019t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn\u2019t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn\u2019t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn\u2019t gone, then this never would\u2019ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue. I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t sleep, I didn\u2019t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t sleep, I didn\u2019t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn\u2019t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn\u2019t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer. The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it\u2019s upsetting, just know that I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m right here, and I\u2019m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay. You don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today. I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant\u2019s statement and respond to them. 15/19 Ivory Coast Recommendation: I urge the Government of Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire to ensure the effective implementation of its national strategy to combat gender-based violence and the action plan for FRCI, and call on the international community to support these efforts. It is critical to accelerate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and strengthen law enforcement to ensure that ex-combatants who have been reintegrated into the transport sector do not pose a risk to women and girls who are reliant on those services. The Government and the international community must provide monitoring and awareness-raising to mitigate the possibility of a recurrence of sexual violence in the context of the presidential elections to be held in October 2015 11/19 Sudan (Darfur) Recommendation: I call upon the Government of the Sudan to grant the United Nations and its humanitarian partners unfettered access for monitoring and the provision of assistance to people in need in Darfur. Given that there has been grave concern over sexual violence in Darfur for more than a decade, I encourage the Government to engage with my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict to develop a framework of cooperation to address the issue comprehensively \ue806 Pinterest I can\u2019t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o\u2019clock in the morning. Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I\u2019m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I\u2019ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak. 2/19 Central African Republic Recommendation: I urge the authorities of the Central African Republic to ensure that efforts to restore security and the rule of law take into account the prevention of sexual violence and that monitoring of the ceasefire and peace agreement explicitly reflects this consideration, in line with the joint communique\u0301 of the Government and the United Nations on the prevention of and response to conflict-related sexual violence signed in December 2012. I further encourage the authorities to make the rapid response unit to combat sexual violence operational and to establish a special criminal court 17/19 Nepal Recommendation: I encourage the Government to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence are recognized under the law as \"conflict victims\", which will enable them to access services, judicial remedies and reparations. I further call on all parties involved in the transitional justice process to ensure that the rights and needs o f survivors of sexual violence are addressed in institutional reforms and that these crimes are excluded from amnesties and statutes of limitations And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don\u2019t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can\u2019t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can\u2019t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you. I\u2019m not mad because you didn\u2019t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don\u2019t care if you know their phone number or not. You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would\u2019ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don\u2019t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll never have a good answer for, that\u2019s what you can\u2019t explain even after a year. 4/19 Congo Recommendation: I urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ensure full implementation of the armed forces action plan against sexual violence, to systematically bring perpetrators to justice and to deliver reparations to victims, including payment of outstanding compensation awards. I call on donors and the United Nations system to support the Government in its efforts and to pay increased attention to neglected areas, including unregulated mining regions My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, \"I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?\" I was horrified. That\u2019s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, \"What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?\" I said yes, and hung up to cry. You said, Being drunk I just couldn\u2019t make the best decisions and neither could she. A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he\u2019s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it? 9/19 Somalia Recommendation: I reiterate my call to the Federal Government of Somalia to implement the commitments made under the joint communique\u0301 of 7 May 2013 and its national action plan to combat sexual violence in conflict, including specific plans for the army and the police. I encourage the adoption of a sexual offences bill as a matter of priority \ue803 Twitter On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don\u2019t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes. 12/19 Syria Recommendation: I acknowledge the Government\u2019s invitation to my Special Representative to visit the Syrian Arab Republic and call upon the authorities, in the context of such a visit, to agree on specific measures to prevent sexual violence, including by members of the security forces. I condemn the use of sexual violence by ISIL and all other parties listed in the annex to the present report and call on them to cease such violations immediately and allow unfettered access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone\u2019s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry. I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney\u2019s closing statement began, \"My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.\" You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her. On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there\u2019s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself \"big mama\", because I knew I\u2019d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college. 19/19 Nigeria Recommendation: I encourage the Government to implement its national action plan on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) to ensure that women\u2019s protection concerns are mainstreamed throughout its security operations. I also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me. 14/19 Bosnia and Herzegovina Recommendation: I urge the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to harmonize legislation and policies so that the rights of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence to reparations are consistently recognized and to allocate a specific budget for this purpose. I further call upon the authorities to protect and support survivors participating in judicial proceedings through, inter alia, referrals to free legal aid, psychosocial and health services, as well as economic empowerment programmes Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on. Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget. 13/19 Yemen Recommendation: I urge the authorities in Yemen to undertake legislative reform as a basis for addressing impunity for sexual violence, ensuring the provision of services for survivors and aligning the minimum legal age of marriage with international standards. I further call on the authorities to engage with local community and faithbased leaders to address sexual and gender-based violence and discriminatory social norms After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don\u2019t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn\u2019t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else. To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me. 5/19 Iraq Recommendation: I commend the Government of Iraq for its national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and urge its swift implementation, including by training its security forces to ensur e respect for women\u2019s rights. Programmes to support the social reintegration of women and girls released from captivity by ISIL are urgently needed, as is community-based medical and psychological care. The capacity of the United Nations system should be enhanced through the deployment of Women\u2019s Protection Advisers or equivalent specialists \ue001 \ue001 Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00 \ue000 Fullscreen Playback Rate 1 \ue00c Subtitles subtitles off \ue008 Captions captions settings I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you\u2019ll begin to help others. You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room. How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What\u2019d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I\u2019d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we\u2019ll let Brock fill it in. 10/19 South Sudan Recommendation: I urge the parties to the conflict in South Sudan to adopt action plans to implement the commitments made under their respective communique\u0301s. I call upon the Government of South Sudan to address the negative impact of customary law on women\u2019s rights and to reflect international human rights standards in national law. I also encourage the African Union to make public and act upon the report of its Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan Your honor, The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don\u2019t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence. captions settings captions off \ue00c Chapters Chapters \ue006 Mute 00:00 \ue805 Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done \ue800 Close Share Video: Share via: \ue801 Facebook My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be. \ue802 Google+ My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m okay, everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let\u2019s go home, let\u2019s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me."}
{"pred": "Still, as Colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said. The tweaking and rebranding of 'Wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and Colicchio said he's hoping to expand 'Wichcraft to other cities in the near future. In the meantime, anyone who won't be visiting in person anytime soon can live vicariously through this must-try BLT recipe, which perfects the classic American sandwich. The BLT is available starting August 1 at the new Tribeca location and all the 'Wichcraft shops. But for anyone trying the recipe at home, there's one crucial secret to making the sandwich come out perfectly, Colicchio says. \"If you\u2019re gonna make a BLT, you have to have great tomatoes, in season and fresh. Otherwise don\u2019t make it.\" Back then, Colicchio and his team already had hits on their hands with Craft and Craftbar\u2014both groundbreaking farm-to-table restaurants when they first opened in Manhattan \u2014and 'Wichcraft was just meant to be a little sandwich shop spinoff. Ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at Craft, \"was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let\u2019s do a sandwich restaurant. And that\u2019s how 'Wichcraft was born,\" Colicchio told The Feast. Over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain\u2014which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in Grand Central this fall\u2014thanks to Colicchio and Ortuzar's knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in NYC. When Top Chef judge and restaurateur Tom Colicchio and his business partner Sisha Ortuzar opened 'Wichcraft 13 years ago, they had no idea it would become as enormous a success as it has\u2014or that its ingenious, flavor-packed sandwiches would become synonymous with \"lunch\" for so many busy New Yorkers. If you're like us, you'll be whipping up this sandwich multiple times a week, all the way through tomato season. In New York, that's typically August until early September, and that's the only time you'll find this BLT on 'Wichcraft's menu. (The sandwich shops use Eckerton Hill Farms tomatoes from the Union Square Greenmarket, along with Berkshire bacon.) After the season is over, it's not just the tomatoes that'll be gone. The sandwich will vanish too. Makes 4 sandwiches Tom Colicchio (right) with Sisha Ortuzar. 'Wichcraft BLT Recipe: In a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Toast the bread on one side only. Evenly spread the aioli on the toasted side of four slices of bread. Place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don\u2019t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered.

{"pred": "Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented. In 2012, voters in California approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. Conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. Also that year, the governor of Kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. Conservative economists predicted a boom. Few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. Or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be Kansas. Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it. [Will higher taxes on the rich derail California\u2019s economic comeback?] While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas\u2019s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills. Neither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week. [Kansas had the ultimate plan to punish the poor] Kansas\u2019s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas\u2019s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand. The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession. The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax. On the whole, Brownback\u2019s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich. California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack. It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley. Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average. The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.

Ruben Guerrero, the husband of Montebello Mayor Christina Cortez, was arrested Thursday morning by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies on suspicion of sales of methamphetamine and sale of narcotics near a school. Authorities believe Guerrero was using his house as a base of operation to deal meth. Mayor Cortez was at home with their children when deputies served her with a search warrant, WebProNews reports. Authorites also searched Cortez\u2019s 89-year-old grandmother's house. In November 1999, he was convicted of driving under the influence. Last year, arson investigators with the Montebello Fire Department investigated a \"suspicious\" fire that burned Cortez's Chevrolet Suburban. Cortez said the vehicle damaged in the early-morning fire on Sept. 28, 2012, was driven mostly by her husband, the Whittier Daily News reported. This year, Montebello Councilman Frank Gomez sought a restraining order against Guerrero, saying the mayor's husband had made threats -- once through voicemail and once at a council meeting. The restraining order was denied in January, court records show. \"Of course I am very disappointed and like everyone else, shocked,\" Mayor Cortez said, NBC reports. \"As an elected official, as a mother and daughter, I have stood behind the education of knowing the dangers of drugs.

{"pred": "Ramen is one of the most popular foods in the country- it\u2019s been having a major moment for years now. Every neighborhood has its ramen shop at this point. Now, it has overtaken tobacco as the number one currency in US prisons, The Guardian reports. According to a study done by Michael Gibson-Light, a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona, decreasing quantity and a decline in quality of food served to US prisoners have made the food a commodity. And the noodles are being traded for a lot more than they\u2019re worth. At the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. A sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen. Prisoners also clean each others bunks for packs of ramen, or gamble with it. The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. \"[Money] doesn\u2019t change unless there\u2019s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\" Gibson-Light said. It\u2019s not all trading and food hacks, though. When something is valuable and being traded on a sort of black market, things can get tricky. At inmate stores, people often buy things on credit. When credit isn\u2019t paid, it leads to problems. \"I\u2019ve seen fights over ramen,\" said one inmate. \"People get killed over soup.\" Ramen has been popular in prison for a long time. Gustavo \"Goose\" Alvarez who spent more than ten years in prison wrote a book about it called Prison Ramen: Recipes and Stories From Behind Bars. It includes recipes that can be made with items available to prisoners, such as tamales \"Doritos, canned pork and beans, and ramen,\" and celebrity ramen recipes. He attributes ramen\u2019s popularity to the fact that it\u2019s \"easy to get\" and \"high in calories,\" something of value to people who \"spend their days working and exercising.\" They need the energy.

{"pred": "Here are America's richest states, according to 24/7 Wall St. The 10 Richest States In America: 24/7 Wall St. While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 \u2014 nearly half that of Maryland\u2019s. The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions. Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state\u2019s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%. States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did. At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed. Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. \"We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don\u2019t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.\" To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty. Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state\u2019s household income. \"When we\u2019re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it\u2019s about jobs.\" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story. Last year, household income remained effectively unchanged, according to data released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012. \"The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year\" said Economic Policy Institute\u2019s Elise Gould. \"We\u2019re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.\" Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008. \"There\u2019s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,\" Danziger said. \"Even when manufacturers haven\u2019t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.\" From 24/7 Wall St."}

{"pred": "If I ask you, \"What do you want out of life?\" and you say something like, \"I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,\" it\u2019s so ubiquitous that it doesn\u2019t even mean anything. Everybody wants something. And everybody wants something enough. They just aren\u2019t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want \"enough.\" If you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isn\u2019t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you don\u2019t actually want it at all. Everybody wants what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when you walk into the room. There\u2019s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, \"You\u2019ve just got to want it enough!\" A more interesting question, a question that perhaps you\u2019ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. Despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came. And it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: I didn\u2019t actually want it. But the truth is far less interesting than that: I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn\u2019t. End of story. That answer will actually get you somewhere. It\u2019s the question that can change your life. It\u2019s what makes me me and you you. It\u2019s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together. Everybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship\u2014but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder \"What if?\" for years and years and until the question morphs from \"What if?\" into \"Was that it?\" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, \"What was that for?\" if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for? What determines your success isn\u2019t \"What do you want to enjoy?\" The question is, \"What pain do you want to sustain?\" The quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life. Because if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. If you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. If you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand. People want a partner, a spouse. But you don\u2019t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It\u2019s part of the game of love. You can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play. Sometimes I ask people, \"How do you choose to suffer?\" These people tilt their heads and look at me like I have twelve noses. But I ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. Because you have to choose something. You can\u2019t have a pain-free life. It can\u2019t all be roses and unicorns. And ultimately that\u2019s the hard question that matters. Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain? Everyone would like that\u2014it\u2019s easy to like that. At the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. Positive experience is easy to handle. It\u2019s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. Therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we\u2019re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings. Everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence\u2014but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blase\u0301 confines of an infinite cubicle hell. People want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth. For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician \u2014 a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. But even then it was never a question of if I\u2019d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I was biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. First, I needed to finish school. Then, I needed to make money. Then, I needed to find the time. Then ... and then nothing. Our culture would tell me that I\u2019ve somehow failed myself, that I\u2019m a quitter or a loser. Self-help would say that I either wasn\u2019t courageous enough, determined enough or I didn\u2019t believe in myself enough. The entrepreneurial/start-up crowd would tell me that I chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning. I\u2019d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something. This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. So choose your struggles wisely, my friend. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesn\u2019t work that way. People want to start their own business or become financially independent. But you don\u2019t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not. People want an amazing physique. But you don\u2019t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions. Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it. This is not a call for willpower or \"grit.\" This is not another admonishment of \"no pain, no gain.\" Because happiness requires struggle. The positive is the side effect of handling the negative. You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life. This post originally appeared on MarkManson.net. Follow @iammarkmanson on Twitter.

{"pred": "Paul Feig Reveals New Ghostbusters Character Names But we still didn\u2019t know what characters the ladies were playing. That changed yesterday when Feig replied to a request to reveal the character names on Twitter from a Ghostsbusters fan and charity organization. Find out the new Ghostbusters character names after the jump! Honestly, as someone who is a massive Ghostbusters fan (I have an entire wall with action figures and original artwork), this is something that I\u2019m not very worried about anymore. As with any reboot or remake, a new take on the material won\u2019t take away from how much I love the original movies. Furthermore, after finally seeing how surprisingly good and funny Spy was earlier this summer, I think Feig can pull this off. Some fans have been trying to match up the new characters with the original Ghostbusters, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spenger (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson). However, we have to keep in mind that this is a Ghostbusters reboot, and not a straight-up remake. So these characters won\u2019t have the exactsame traits as the original team. Director Paul Feig has been revealing quite a bit from his forthcoming Ghostbusters reboot that\u2019s currently shooting in New York City. We\u2019ve already seen the new proton packs (with added specs to help cosplayers), the new Ecto-1, and a shot of Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones all suited up and ready to bust ghosts. Ghostbusters arrives next summer on July 22nd, 2016. As for the supporting cast, we already know some details about their characters. Andy Garcia is playing the mayor of New York City, Michael K. Williams is a character named Hawkins, Matt Walsh is a character named Rourke (I could easily see him working for the mayor), Chris Hemsworth is the new secretary for the Ghostbusters, and Saturday Night Live writer Neil Casey is the film\u2019s villain. And let\u2019s not forget that Dan Ayrkoyd also confirmed that he\u2019ll have a cameo in the film in a scene with Kristen Wiig. Here\u2019s what Feig wrote on Twitter: Okay, here you go. Erin Gilbert, Jillian Holtzmann, Abby Yates and Patty Tolan.

Their reasons may vary widely \u2014 from looking to lose weight to building muscle and getting chiseled. Some men even go to experience a place of solace; somewhere outside of the house and away from work where they can relax, hit the steam room, or just burn off some calories on the treadmill. But new research indicates there are actually body image issues at play driving more men to fitness centers than you might expect. Specifically, it\u2019s \"men\u2019s hidden fears about body fat\" that are driving gym attendance, according to a team of researchers from the University of Lincoln (U.K.) and Australia\u2019s Curtin University. The study says these men are motivated by \"feelings of guilt and shame rather than a desire to build muscle,\" which may come as a surprise to many \u2014 even men who may not be willing to admit it to themselves. Body image issues aren\u2019t typically associated with men, though they are fairly widespread. According to a recent study published in Psychology of Men & Masculinity, as many as 20% to 40% of American men are struggling with body image problems in some shape or form. It shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise then, that a newer study has revealed such body image issues are spurring millions of men to hit the gym \u2014 even though many would probably never admit it."}

{"pred": "The original film, released in 1971 and directed by Mel Stuart, starred the late screen icon Gene Wilder as the titular Willy Wonka. Wilder died at the age of 83 on Sunday, due to complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease at his home in Stamford, Connecticut. Wilder wanted Wonka to be completely unpredictable, and as we all know, he got his wish. The scene featuring Wonka\u2019s grand entrance is one of the most memorable in the film, thanks to Wilder\u2019s imagination and creativity. Wilder also provided some input about Wonka\u2019s costume after seeing the first sketches. According to Letters of Note, the actor wrote a letter to Stuart offering up some suggestions for the character\u2019s signature look. Without Wilder the film may have been good, but with him, it was wonderful. As it turns out, however, the actor wasn\u2019t always sold on the role. In fact, he only agreed to play the famous candyman under one condition. When asked why he wanted to do this, Wilder simply said, \"Because from that time on, no one will know if I\u2019m lying or telling the truth.\" \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" is one of those movies that transcends time. \"When I make my first entrance. I\u2019d like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I\u2019m walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\" As reported by Letters of Note, Wilder told Stuart: \"I don\u2019t think of Willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 Dandy\u2019s Sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric \u2014 where there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019ll do or where he ever found his get-up \u2014 except that it strangely fits him: Part of this world, part of another,\" he wrote, adding, \"A vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste.

{"pred": "The One Strange Word You're Seeing/Hearing Everyone Use Right Now Not long after noticing friends and coworkers using \"slash\" in everyday conversation, I started seeing it cropping up everywhere, all the time. While it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible. It was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense. Either spelled out in five characters (\"slash\") or just one (\"/\"), I saw it used to tack on subsequent ideas that could have been expressed in other, perfectly conventional ways. But they weren't. We can't say. To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called \"a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and/or admit new members.\" \"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\" In digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It's a match made in, um, some factory in China. English speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\" The slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\") After so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8/30/2014\") and fractions (\"3/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV. Usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\" Correction: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K. Pullum's last name. Breakfast slash lunch! Yum! @ Max's Restaurant, SM Mall of Asia http://t.co/oSSwgVkLA4 \u2014 Uriel Yu Medellin (@itsmeuriel) August 4, 2014 Grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses. Tell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\" But will it stick around? \"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses."}

Sure, you\u2019ve got 16-ish hours away from the job each day, but is that enough time to enjoy all your personal, family, community, and social commitments without becoming a harried, frazzled unproductive mess? An ongoing study out of Sweden seems to indicate that a shorter work day may actually result in more productivity. While workers reported feeling better about the jobs and their contribution, employers that took part in the experiment found a 30-hour work week sharply reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, enhanced creativity, and reduced turnover. \"We thought doing a shorter workweek would mean we\u2019d have to hire more, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in that because everyone works more efficiently,\" the owner tells the Times. \"Since we work fewer hours, we are constantly figuring out ways to do more with our time.\" In Sweden, an Experiment Turns Shorter Workdays Into Bigger Gains [The New York Times] By knocking off 10 hours of work each week for a year, employees at a Swedish nursing home were able to improve their health, cut back on sick leave, and enhance the care of their charges, The New York Times reports. Under the experiment, which focused on the future of work in Gothenburg, employees began working six-hour days at the same pay rate as their previous eight-hour days. \"We\u2019ve had 40 years of a 40-hour workweek, and now we\u2019re looking at a society with higher sick leave and early retirement,\" Daniel Bernmar, leader of the political party running the trial, said. \"We want a new discussion in Sweden about how work life should be to maintain a good welfare state for the next 40 years.\" \"What\u2019s good is that we\u2019re happy,\" one employee tells the Times. \"And a happy worker is a better worker.\" One employee says that after just one week he was more energized and residents said their standard of care had improved. The owner of a start-up in Stockholm, which operates on a six-hour day but didn\u2019t take part in the study, says the shorter days have assisted the small company to double its revenue and profit for the past three years. Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg tried a similar trial last year. The hospital\u2019s orthopedics unit switched 89 nurses and doctors to a six-hour day. But unlike the start-up, it had to hire 15 additional workers. While the trial initially cost the hospital an additional $123,000 a month, it reduced sick calls, and increased the efficiency of the healthcare workers. Some opponents of the option contend that the country\u2019s economy would suffer from reduced competitiveness and strained finances, the Times reports. Although the tests have been helpful to both participating companies and employees, the concept hasn\u2019t been greeted with open arms by everyone. \"We can\u2019t pay people to not work,\" Maria Ryde\u0301n, Gothenburg\u2019s deputy mayor, who is working to put an end to the trial, tells the Times."}

Some radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the CFF that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. In fact, it goes further than that. They are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in Croatian football. They are natural questions to ask, but not easy to answer. This is the background, though. A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely. Among the players and coaching staff on Friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment. Croatia have four points after two games but no one was talking about the 2-2 draw against the Czech Republic . \"Maybe it would be best if we don\u2019t play at all,\" said Ivan Perisic, who scored the opening goal for Croatia. \"Maybe that would actually be better in case these things are going to happen every time we play.\" Croatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to Friday\u2019s match. Many fans in Croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair \u2013 as well as Davor Suker, the CFF president who is seen by many as their puppet \u2013 and turned it into a tool for making money. Mamic and Vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long \u2013 and at the moment unsuccessful \u2013 campaign to have them removed via the legal system. Their aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. Other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. It is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this. Why would a set of supporters try to stop a game while their team is winning? And why would they then start a fight among themselves? They claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. The federation\u2019s vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was chief executive there. Damir Vrbanovic, the federation\u2019s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case. Last year, they were taken into custody (Mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. Finally, Mamic was suspended from working at Dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the VIP lounge at the game against the Czechs. And, ultimately, the losers will be the players and the supporters who would love nothing more than having their national team back. The coach, Ante Cacic, added: \"We are all to blame. Let\u2019s not start washing our hands from it.\" He is right, nothing will be won by people in authority not taking control of this ugly situation.

Below are the key highlights from our conversation. The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor. \"Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,\" said Azor, also Alienware's fourth employee. \"Well that's just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.\" VR is an industry-wide effort As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it's still in its early days. That's because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo's Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more. \"The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,\" Gonzalez said. \"And not just sitting down; if you're a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it's there, it's going to happen.\" \"Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,\" he said. \"VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.\" It's unclear exactly how \u2014 and if \u2014 technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift. Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama , which incorporated elements like wind and smells. Strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That's the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you're swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn't yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez. It's unlikely that we'll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn't advancing at the same pace as VR hardware. There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that's wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance. Delegates use the Gear VR (virtual reality) headset, manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co., at the Samsung Unpacked launch event ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016. A wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content. Anyone who's seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush. \"By the time we solve that, as an industry we're going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,\" Azor said. \"Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that's where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.\""}

{"pred": "While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners. During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system. In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote: However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body. The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019. But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum. The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet. Currently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet. Airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane. In 2015 Boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever \"We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well,\" a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. \"We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude.\" For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. \"The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue,\" Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview. \"Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet,\" Kent Craver, Boeing Commercial Airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. \"In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level.\" The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet. Why does air pressure matter to passengers?\u200b \"Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness.\" \"To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin,\" Emery added. \"It's a bit counterintuitive for most people.\" At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. \"The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level,\" Emery said. \"So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet.\" The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called \"increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours\" of exposure. Why haven't we had this all along?"}

It seems Blizzard isn\u2019t one to go back on its words. Last month it promised that it\u2019ll ban any cheaters or hackers in Overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided. Anyone using Overwatch cheat programs are being banned by Blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program\u2019s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass Blizzard\u2019s security. Blizzard\u2019s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. It unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. The company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating. The moral of this story is clear as day, and it\u2019s that you should not even think about cheating while playing Overwatch. No matter how smart you think you are, it\u2019ll only end in one result, and that\u2019s getting banned not once, but possibly forever. And no, using a VPN might not be enough since many users have reported that Blizzard managed to ban them even though they used a VPN. That\u2019s not all, however. A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you\u2019ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game. The only solution: play fair and do not cheat. Simple?"}

The tradition was inspired by the Venetians, who threw their old and unwanted possessions out of their windows on New Year\u2019s Day. It was adopted by the islanders and applied to the most important day in their calendar. Already bored of hot cross buns and egg hunts? These nine countries are looking forward to a four-day festival filled with weirdness.  Halloween in spring: Sweden On Maundy Thursday, Swedish children don face paint and grab broomsticks to dress up as witches and go door-to-door asking for sweets. According to Swedish legend, witches visited the forest of Blakulla before Easter, to party with the devil as he held his earthy court. Residents of Fredericksburg dress up as Easter Bunnies, pioneers and Comanches and parade through their tiny town before setting the hills surrounding it on fire. As the fires blaze the towns\u2019 lights are lowered as part of the Easter Fires Pageant. The ceremony began in 1847 to celebrate the peace accord signed between German settlers and Native Americans. Villagers in Haux, Gironde embark on their yearly quest to feed all 1,000 residents with a giant omelette on Easter Monday. On a hand built fire in the town square chefs use 5,000 eggs and 110 pounds of bacon, onion, and garlic to create the 10 ft wide dish. The village feast has only been an annual event for 30 years but many trace it back to a tale that Napoleon demanded a giant egg dish be prepared for his troops as they passed through the countryside.  The procession of La Madonna Che Scappa (The Dashing Madonna) is held on Easter Sunday in Sulmona, in the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy. Followers carry statues of the Risen Christ, Saint John and Saint Peter to the Church of San Filippo Neri to announce the news of the Resurrection to the mourning Madonna of Loreto. After persuasion from the saints the Madonna slowly moves out and then suddenly dashes to meet her son, with the sound of firecrackers accompanying her sprint. Churches across Greece celebrate midnight mass with a fireworks display but the island of Chios takes it to the next level with two rival churches engaging in a \u2018rocket war\u2019 or Rouketopolemos. The parishes of St. Mark's and Panaghia Ereithiani are built on hilltops 400 metres from each other and they fire hundreds of homemade rockets at the opposition\u2019s belfry throughout the night. Direct hits to the bell tower are counted the next morning when the winner is declared. On Wet Monday dedicated men follow the ancient tradition of dumping a bucket of cold water over an unsuspecting young woman when she answers her front door. This Slovak gem is said to bless the soaked individual with fertility and strength. The men are then invited in and rewarded with dyed eggs, money and vodka. Bunny killing: New Zealand On Good Friday devoted Catholics across the Philippines line up to take part in re-enactments of Christ\u2019s crucifixion, complete with self-flagellation and cross dragging. The city of San Fernando holds a passion play, culminating in the actual nailing of at least three devotees to wooden crosses in front of spectators. The Catholic Church has tried to dissuade followers from the practise and the Department of Health suggests participants should get a Tetanus shot and use sterilised nails. Fluffy rabbits may be synonymous with spring birth and joy but in Central Otago, New Zealand they are classed as crop destroying pests.

{"pred": "That conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \"figure out what the government really does with the money,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"What really happens?\" On Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments. \"Then people say, \u2018Those damn bureaucrats!\u2019\" Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \"Well, let\u2019s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.\" And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows. Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we\u2019re very glad to have. \"I love this one!\" he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \"Don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look!\" He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page. In an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer\u2019s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table. Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove  \"Let\u2019s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\" he said. \"I\u2019m happy to fund the damn thing.\" \"How many people work for government in the United States?\" he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \"Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\" \"But come on, doesn\u2019t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\" Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net. His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \"My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\" he said. \"And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m missing.\" With an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants. Mr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data \u2014 which rebut his preconceptions \u2014 could change his own politics. \"I would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"People can disagree about what to do \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell people what to do.\" But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \"on common data sets that are believable.\" So how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation\u2019s data? For Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data. \"We\u2019re making philanthropic donations elsewhere \u2014 I think of this as another,\" he said, referring to himself and his wife. \"I don\u2019t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don\u2019t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it\u2019s a civic contribution more than anything else.\" \"Now people might not think they\u2019re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people \u2014 and most of these people you like,\" Mr. Ballmer said. One rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data \u2014 no outside providers \u2014 to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges. \"Take the mortgage deduction,\" he continued. \"This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\" At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \"If you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they\u2019re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about them.\" \"You\u2019ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"Because I\u2019m a citizen, I don\u2019t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what\u2019s going on.\" \"Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\" Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \"I mean it\u2019s funny, but I didn\u2019t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\" \"And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\" Mr. Ballmer continued. \"Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\" Her answer: \"A, it won\u2019t, because there are things government doesn\u2019t get to, and B, you\u2019re missing it.\" There is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \"along with other data, but not a total,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t show it! I\u2019m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can\u2019t report the data.\" His other big surprises? As he looked for a new endeavor \u2014 before he decided to buy the Clippers \u2014 his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected. Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this. Mr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports. \"You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I\u2019d get their 10-K and read it,\" he told me in a recent interview in New York. \"It\u2019s wonky, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s the greatest depth you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s accurate.\" Mr. Ballmer calls it \"the equivalent of a 10-K for government,\" referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make. When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \"I don\u2019t, quote, \u2018have anything to do.\u2019\" But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself. For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \"You know it\u2019s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\" Guess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It\u2019s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday. But neither option led him to what he was looking for. Want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That\u2019s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways. Mr. Ballmer replied, \"No, I\u2019m not.\""}

{"pred": "Why you SHOULD be selfish at work: Helping others will lead to 'generosity burnout' and can damage your career And in the workplace putting your needs before those of your colleagues is often seen as selfish behaviour. They believe that selflessness at work leads to exhaustion, and ironically often hurts the people you intended to help. 'When they don\u2019t protect themselves, their investments in others can cause them to feel overloaded and fatigued, fall behind in their work goals, and face more stress and conflict at home', they said. Their work shows it's about balancing time so when you help other people you don't set yourself back in the process. Not only in teaching, but selfless people suffer most in workplaces and find themselves drowning in admin and unable to pursue their own goals as a result. But new research says being selfless at work can backfire. Giving at the expense of your own well-being damages your chance of long-term success. 'Although givers are the most valuable people in organizations, they\u2019re also at the greatest risk for burnout', the authors wrote in The Harvard Business Review. 3. Don't be afraid to refer work to other people when you don't have time. We're always being encouraged to help others before we help ourselves. In an article for The Harvard Business Review, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor, Dr Adam Grant and Wharton People Analytics researcher Reb Rebele explore the 'generosity burnout'. 'Selfless educators exhausted themselves trying to help everyone with every request', the authors said. Dr Grant and Mr Rebele explain that you need to remember three key things when giving to other people: 'being thoughtful about how you help, when you help, and whom you help.' 2. Give in a way that is in your own interest and preserves your own energy resources. 5- Dedicate blocks of time to giving rather than doing it all the time. It'll make you more focussed and effective. Imagine that you're teaching a geometry class, and you've volunteered to stay after school one day a week to help one of your students, Alex, improve his understanding of geometry. He asks if you'll also help his friend Juan, who isn't in your class. What would you do? Their research also showed people who protect their own time can give the most long-term contribution. The teachers who protected themselves and were less selfless got their students better marks. 6 - Avoid people who only take - they'll drain your energy. No one can be available all the time to help other people. 1. Prioritise - say yes when it matters most. c. Tell Alex that it's nice that he wants to help Juan, but he really needs to focus on his own work in order to catch up. At the start of the year they asked them questions about their approach to helping others. a. Schedule a separate after-school session to help Juan, so you can better understand his individual needs. In the end, they were damaging the very students they wanted to help. Surprisingly, the pupils with teachers who answered (a) did the worst in their end of year exams. Here is a sample question from their test, quoted in Business Insider: 4. Amplify your impact - look for ways to help many people in a single gesture. d. Tell Alex that Juan should ask his own teacher for help. In their currently unpublished research, authors Dr Grant and Mr Rebele studied a range of jobs. Source:  Harvard Business Review Their answers allowed the authors to predict how well their students would do in their exams at the end of the year. b. Invite Juan to sit in on your geometry sessions with Alex. One data set came from a study conducted with more than 400 teachers in schools throughout the US."}
{"pred": "The One Strange Trick That Will Help You Live Longer: Have a Bunch of Money In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys\u2014access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food\u2014to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live. But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy. Meditating inside a beautiful stock-photo room filled with plants is just one health benefit not available to poor people. Photo via Getty Here's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities\u2014big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.\u2014live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\" The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco\u2014rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012. The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\" \"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty. Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values. Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\" Reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs\u2014that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer? For the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live\u2014they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\""}

{"pred": "The Bizarre New Way To Eat Eggs That Has Everyone Going Crazy Cured egg yolks are delicious\u2014but strong. Because they're super salty, they're better used as condiment than as the main event. For an umami boost, try grating them just like cheese over pasta, salads, avocado toast, popcorn, or even scrambled eggs. Currently, cured yolks aren't even available in the most upscale grocery stores, so you'll have to make your own. Even better if you're raising chickens at home and have your own fresh eggs on hand. Fortunately, the process couldn't be easier. Here's how: 5. At this point, the eggs yolks should be semi-firm and look sort of like dried apricots. Use them right away, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks. *In case you missed the memo, egg yolks are totally good for you. They're packed with protein, vitamin D, and omega-3s. And even though egg yolks are high in cholesterol, for most people, consuming dietary cholesterol doesn't increase your blood cholesterol. 2. Separate 4 egg yolks, saving the whites for another use. Carefully place each egg yolk on top of the salt-sugar mixture, and gently sprinkle the yolks with the rest of the salt-sugar mixture. (This photo shows the eggs before they were completely covered. You want them to be totally submerged in the salt-sugar mixture.) Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 days. 3. Remove the egg yolks from the fridge after 4 days. Use a pastry brush to gently brush the salt-sugar mixture off of the egg yolks. Run the yolks under cold water to wash any of the remaining salt-sugar mixture off. 4. Place the yolks on a paper towel to drain and pat off any excess water. Transfer the yolks to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake them at 150 degrees for 2 hours. 1. Start by combining 1 cup salt and 1 cup sugar in a bowl. Mix well to combine. Place half the mixture in a small baking dish."}

Dogs like Flynn provide crucial medical assistance, and while they're working, they need to be 100 percent focused. Reiss explained that assistance dogs are trained to go from \"being on to off in a few seconds,\" from hanging out with a chew toy to helping their human in the blink of an eye. When strangers stop to play with assistance dogs, they can interfere with their work. Hailey sums it up this way: \"If you wouldn't do it to a wheelchair, please don't do it to our dogs.\" Hailey has had Flynn since November 2014, when the Australian shepherd puppy began his training with her as a medical alert dog. But when Flynn was only 7 months old, a stranger accidentally put Hailey in harm's way by stopping to pet Flynn \u2014 and the incident illustrates exactly why working dogs should never be pet or played with while they're working. CCI is a nonprofit that trains assistance dogs, including companion dogs and service dogs, and then matches them to people with disabilities. CCI does not train medical alert dogs like Flynn. \"Since Flynn was only about 7 months at the time of the accident, he was, and still is, learning to ignore people petting him,\" Hailey explained. \"We understand our dogs are super cute, but they are really important for our safety and health.\" Flynn the dog does a lot to help out his 17-year-old human, Hailey Ashmore: He can open and close doors, fetch her parents and, most importantly, alert her to oncoming seizures. Hailey was visiting her dad at work when someone began petting Flynn like he was just a regular pup. \"I immediately told him to stop,\" Hailey told The Dodo. But in just a moment of distraction Flynn had missed a crucial opportunity to warn Hailey about an oncoming seizure. When he did warn her, it was too late. \"I thought I had 10 minutes to get safe, take medication and call somebody for help,\" Hailey told The Dodo. \"Unfortunately, I didn't and ended up getting a nasty rug burn.\" \"They're not a piece of equipment,\" Reiss said. \"They can be distracted.\" Hailey Ashmore Hailey Ashmore Hailey Ashmore"}

The Queen is believed to have supported same-sex marriage. When a newspaper claimed that she opposed gay people marrying, Buckingham Palace sent journalists PinkNews articles claiming that she supports equality. Whilst the couple have a strict no public affection rule, they are now out to all of their friends and family. \"In different ways, we both struggled. Now everyone in our family knows and could not be more supportive.\" said Mountbatten. \"Neither of us wanted to have relationships which were transitory; the stereotypical view of gay relationships is that they are too fleeting, too frequent.\" Prince Harry previously joked that he might try a relationship with a man if it doesn\u2019t work out with women. Last year, Prince William visited a school to participate in a lesson to tackle homophophic bullying. Whilst having a boyfriend has provided the Lord with some learning curves, it\u2019s also been a blessing in disguise. His daughters like having another man in the house, rather than a step-mother.

When an audience member asked Brandon and this panelists to share what kept them motivated on the path to financial independence during an episode of his \"Financial Independence Podcast,\" he responded that instead of struggling to stick to his savings goals, he coped with putting away too much. Early retirement is supposed to be freeing and empowering, not constricting. By avoiding anything that involved spending money, Brandon ended up dodging his friends and depriving himself of even the little things that brought him joy. But his journey to financial independence taught him a valuable lesson: Saving isn't everything. \"Focus on the power that you're getting along the way with all that money that you're saving up, and use that power to make your life a lot better along the way,\" he says. \"Don't sacrifice happiness for that final number in the bank.\" To get there, Brandon (who doesn't use his last name online for privacy reasons) chose to live frugally in rural Vermont, where he managed to save and invest about 70% of his after-tax income In 2014, Brandon and his wife \u2014who has no interest in retiring early and keeps her finances largely separate from her husband's \u2014 moved to Scotland, where he continued to work for a few more years, eventually putting away enough to allow him to retire at 34.

{"pred": "Last month, I left my three children for almost two full weeks to travel across Nicaragua with my stepmother and sister. The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\" This is why I needed a vacation. Alone. Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\" My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well. I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were. \"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip. So go on. Leave the kids with Daddy. It's good for everyone. And I promise when you do, I will never ask you who is taking care of them. Because I will already know. So why the question? OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless \u2014 from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track. Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map. Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that's exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. Fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them. If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them. My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it. Why would anyone find this shocking? Most Popular Why are we accepting this as normal?"}

The unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh\u2019s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into \"good\" and \"bad.\" Moshfegh\u2019s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people.  Reading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom \"Peep Show.\" There\u2019s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It\u2019s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it\u2019s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh\u2019s talent is a sheer delight \u2015 and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we\u2019re not such an elevated species as we\u2019d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast.  NPR: \"There\u2019s not a story in Homesick for Another World that\u2019s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh\u2019s talent is unique, and her characters \u2014 unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic \u2014 are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.\" Ottessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she\u2019d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets. Moshfegh\u2019s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They\u2019re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they\u2019re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt. The protagonist of \"Malibu,\" the third short story in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s new collection, spends his time making up job applications so he can continue to receive unemployment benefits and try to coax money out of his aging uncle, who has a colostomy bag and does little but eat fatty meals in front of daytime TV. He\u2019s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he\u2019ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex.

In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women\u2019s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: \"I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home.\" She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job. In a story called \"The Beach Boy,\" a man\u2019s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island.

He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.\" Oh, and then there are his hands. \"As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,\" he admits. \"I had small hands. They were like a girl\u2019s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that.\" When he goes to a meet-up he\u2019s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck.

The $116.8 billion Saudi Arabia owns puts it in the top 12 foreign nations with holdings of U.S. debt, falling between India and Singapore. Its total pales in comparison to China\u2019s whopping $1.3 trillion and Japan\u2019s $1.1 trillion. The kingdom\u2019s holdings of American Treasury bills have previously been grouped in with the 14 nations that comprise the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), like Kuwait and Venezuela. Together, those countries own about $281 billion in U.S. debt, down from $298.4 billion in January. Saudi holdings of Treasuries peaked at $123.6 billion in January, the data released Monday show. The numbers were made public as part of the Treasury\u2019s regular monthly reports. The disclosure comes during an unusually tense time in U.S.-Saudi relations. Last month Saudi officials warned the country would sell off $750 billion worth of Treasuries and other assets in the states if Congress approved a bill that would allow the monarchy to be sued in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. A Freedom of Information Act request filed by A Freedom of Information Act request filed by Bloomberg News led to the Treasury Department breaking down the assets by country. The U.S. started releasing data on foreign ownership of Treasuries in 1974, but had never specified how much Saudi Arabia holds. The Treasury Department\u2019s disclosure answers one of the questions surrounding the relationship between the two countries and shows that the monarchy, while an important player in the U.S. financial system, doesn\u2019t have as much leverage as many likely believed. Officials in Washington and Riyadh were already on edge because President Obama is said to be seriously considering declassifying 28 pages of a congressional report into the 2001 attacks that some say indicate the hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi Arabian, received support, explicit or otherwise, from the country\u2019s vast royal family. Intelligence officials have been reviewing whether to make the pages public since 2014 and are due to deliver a recommendation to the president. Whatever the recommendation, the White House has said Obama could ultimately use his executive authority to make the pages public."}
{"pred": "But today, unsettled viewers might be able to find some peace. Spirited Away fans have long speculated over the deeper meaning of fantastical moments in the film , and now we're finally getting some answers. Albeit being a bit vague, the meaning behind Chihiro's parents transformation deepens the theme on greed and sheds light on a part of Japanese history that most Spirited Away fans don't know much about. Japan's market crash of 1991 threw the country into a financial crisis so severe it's remembered today as the \"lost decades\" and Miyazaki used Chihiro's parents as a reminder that greed leads to devastating consequences. The metaphor also serves as a reminder of the richness behind Ghibli films. Twitter user @0910noncha sent some questions about the film to Studio Ghibli earlier this year, and to her delight, she got a thoughtful reply from a Ghibli employee, which she posted to her Twitter account on July 9. She wanted to know why the Chihiro's parents turned into pigs, what was in their food, and how she managed to pass her final exam. In the letter Studio Ghibli explained that the swine transformation represented the greed that took place during Japan's bubble economy of the 80s. Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away gave me nightmares worse than after watching The Exorcist. I will forever live in the fear of finding out my parents have turned into pigs, perhaps somewhat irrationally, mostly because that detail was never clear to me after watching the movie fifteen years ago. The letter explained that once someone transforms into a pig, it's irreversible, and Miyazaki used the metaphor to describe the real world and how greed changes people. \"This doesn\u2019t just apply to the fantasy world,\" it read. The letter went on to say that none of the pigs in the pen were Chihiro's parents, which she knew because \"as a 10-year-old girl, could understand the difference because she had overcome difficulties and had managed to acquire the 'energy to live' \u2014 which is something everyone can do naturally,\" the letter stated according to a translation by RocketNews24."}

The title, Al-Maria says, is in part a reference to the American \"national holiday of shopping,\" but also a nod to the holy nature of Fridays in Islam. In \"Black Friday\" Al-Maria will show the tangible results of such development; the physical waste produced by a society obsessed with the latest electronic gadget. This phenomenon of fervent consumerism also feeds into our perception of what constitutes a piece of art. More than anything, Gulf Futurism is perhaps an investigation into some of the more negative aspects of a hyper-connected digital society that can sometimes be a lonely place -- a perspective Al-Maria describes as \"techno-pessimistic.\" Her solo show \" Black Friday ,\" which opens at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art on July 26, will comprise over 100 new videos, screened on a series of broken or rejected consumer electronics. Born in 1983, she describes herself as an early digital native, part of the first crop of millennials. While the rise of the Internet was a key aspect of her formative years, her work often deals with the isolating nature of the digital space. Witnessing this evolution inspired her to coin the term \"Gulf Futurism,\" inspired by \"the idea that time travel had literally occurred in one generation [in Qatar], from a sort of pre-agrarian society -- at least in terms of Bedouin culture -- deep into hyper capitalism and consumerism,\" as Al-Maria describes it. Techno-pessimism Growing up in Qatar provided a unique vantage point from which to witness the rapid evolution of history, in a commercial and technological sense. While much time is spent thinking of digital art as forward thinking and innovative, the cost of this innovation may be a reduced life span for the artworks, which have used the technological tools available to them in their time. \"Black Friday\" sits comfortably in Al-Maria's roster of projects. Exemplifying of a new generation of creative polymaths, the writer-filmmaker-artist has produced photos, directed films, written articles and screenplays, and published a critically acclaimed memoir, \"The Girl Who Fell to Earth.\" As Al-Maria puts it: \"There's planned obsolescence in the devices, so there's planned obsolescence in the art. Planned obsolescence \"A few years ago I had a real feeling of heaviness through things like Facebook, like I was dragging the ghost of every person I had ever met. Maybe it doesn't create community in the way that people think because with the ability to post whatever you want at any time, you also get the ugly side,\" Al-Maria says. \"The thing is that people's concept of art is still very much object based,\" she explains, \"So even with a video piece, people will expect there to be something to play it on.\" In her memoir Al-Maria talks about being brought up between two vastly different cultures. Born to an American mother and a Qatari Bedouin father, she spent her childhood in the US before moving to Qatar. There, she experienced the intense and rapid technological and cultural development of the Gulf. (CNN) American-Qatari artist Sophia Al-Maria is preparing for the biggest exhibition of her career.

{"pred": "5 Essential Investing Moves For Millennials Here are five crucial moves Millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties. If you believe recent reports from the web, you probably think Millennials are financial floozies, trading their retirement money for Venti lattes. You can learn more about building a diversified portfolio in NerdWallet's piece on investing in your 20s. At least this one will be free. Investing is understandably scary. Until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in Vegas without the free drinks. 3. Take that risk through index funds The reality is probably not that bad, but also not as click-worthy: Research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies indicates that nearly three-quarters of Millennials are saving for retirement and that we started doing so at an earlier age than previous generations. Wells Fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more. But a 2015 study from BlackRock found that Millennials might have as much as 70% of their money in cash, meaning a savings account, a pillowcase, old sneakers. At today's historically low interest rates, it's all roughly the same. That $5,000 becomes just $8,000 at a 1% return; in your shoe, it stays $5,000. Factor in inflation   a force that Millennials may soon notice for the first time in their adult lives   and you're actually losing money. About 70% would be a reasonable stock allocation for your retirement portfolio   and even that might be on the low side. At this age, you should have most of your long-term savings invested in stocks. The best way to do that is not by dumping your money into Apple stock, but with low-cost index and exchange-traded funds. Those funds pool investor money to buy many different investments in one swoop. You can buy a couple of funds that hold the stock of U.S. companies, one that holds international companies and one that holds emerging-markets companies and you'll be reasonably diversified. 5. Use a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) There are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. Khan Academy is a good place to start, as is NerdWallet's guide on how to invest in stocks. Morningstar has a good, if slightly dated, investing classroom, and online brokers often have a ton of beginner-focused educational materials on their websites. Why choose a Roth? If your income is lower now than it will be later   a likely scenario for many young professionals   you're locking in at lower tax rate. And because you're not getting a tax benefit now, you get to pull out the money   both your contributions and investment growth   tax free in retirement. To see how valuable that is, use a Roth IRA calculator. In investing, more risk means the potential for more reward. Investments that require you to take on risk, like stocks, have to offer you a premium for doing so. Could you lose money and never collect that premium? Sure, but that's unlikely when you're in it for the long-term.  What we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. Many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. That's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place. History illustrates this: A portfolio of 100% stocks had an average annual return of 10.1% between 1926 and 2015, according to a study by Vanguard. A portfolio of 100% bonds returned roughly half that, averaging 5.4%. To put that into real-money terms, if you invested $5,000 for 50 years at a 10.1% return, you'd have $614,000. At a 5.4% return, you'd have just $69,000. You can't control the ups and downs of the stock market. What you can mostly control are investing costs   fees charged by your index funds (called expense ratios), administrative fees in your 401(k) and transaction fees incurred when you buy and sell investments. Every dollar that goes to these costs is a dollar that reduces your returns. Keep transaction costs down by limiting unnecessary trading and using commission-free and no-transaction-fee funds. Most brokers will have a list of both types of funds. If an index fund's expense ratio is more than 0.25%, you can likely do better with another. 1. Get an education 4. Put a lid on fees Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are made with pre-tax dollars; you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement. But you can also pay taxes now and spare your future self the burden by choosing a Roth IRA (check Roth contribution limits to gauge your eligibility) or the Roth version of your 401(k), if your employer offers that option. Risk is kind of like that friend who regularly cancels plans but always comes through in a pinch. There might be heartache in the day-to-day, but in the long run, you'll be glad you stuck it out. 2. Say hello to risk"}

The veterinary procedure has been offered for many years, but that could cease to be the case, at least in New York, if legislation to ban the practice goes though. The gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in New York. \"It's the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off,\" veterinarian Jennifer Conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a Daily Freeman reporter. Kristine Brabson, site director of GoodHousekeeping.com and devout cat lover (she has six of them), strongly opposes declawing. \"It's torture to cats. Why would Mother Nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?\" For those who don't own cats, declawing may sound like simple nail clipping, but it's a very serious medical operation. Medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. Feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones. To remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. The human equivalent, as the Human Society of the United States describes it, is \"cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.\" Many cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture. To that, assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, who is sponsoring the bill, says: Meanwhile, many veterinarians understand the concern regarding the procedure, but disagree with a ban. \"None of us love the procedure. But when the alternative is condemning the cat to a shelter or to death? That's why we do it,\" says veterinarian New York City Richard Goldstein. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports the procedure, but \"only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents an above normal health risk for its owner(s).\" Still, 130 New York vets are completely supportive of the ban. The controversial practice is already banned in Los Angeles, Australia, Britain and many countries in Europe. This ban marks the first time the issue has reached statewide level in the U.S, the Associated Press reports. Cat Claw Removal \"I've heard so many times: 'I have expensive furniture! I have nice drapes!\u200b If your standard is, 'I need pristine furniture,' don't get a cat.\" The bill is currently with the Senate and Assembly, but no voting date has been determined, reports the Huffington Post.

{"pred": "Michael Sam Comes Out As Gay: Missouri Football Star Could Be 1st Openly Gay NFL Player Former Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam, named a first-team All-American after the 2013 season, has publicly come out as gay. The college football standout is eligible for the 2014 NFL Draft and is poised to become the first active openly gay player in the league's history. He spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time to The New York Times and ESPN on Sunday. \"By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.\" \"I don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet,\" an anonymous NFL player personnel assistant said, reported Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans of Sports Illustrated. \"In the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It'd chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.\" Although several former NFL players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. In April 2013, veteran NBA center Jason Collins came out with a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated. The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. A month later, former U.S. national soccer team player Robbie Rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional North American team sport when he stepped onto the field for the L.A. Galaxy of the MLS. \"Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, \" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. I think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time.\" Never cared if Michael was gay... As long as he put that pass rush on the QB and made my job easier i didnt give a damn... \u2014 Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014 \"I am an openly, proud gay man,\" Sam told ESPN. Sam had been planning on coming out publicly before the NFL Draft but he had initially intended for the news to break after the NFL Combine, according to Outsports' behind-the-scenes look at the announcement. His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality. \"I understand how big this is,\" Sam told ESPN. \"It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.\" After coming out to his teammates and coaches during the preseason, Sam starred on the field as the Missouri rolled to a 12-2 record and a 41-31 win in the Cotton Bowl. Given the type of year that Sam had, he was rated as the 12th-best outside pass rusher available in the upcoming NFL draft by ESPN Scouts Inc. and projected to be a mid-round selection. With the NFL's readiness for its first active openly gay player an open question, Sam's draft position will be watched closely in May. Several unnamed NFL personnel members interviewed by Sports Illustrated after Sam's announcement believed that coming out would adversely affect his draft stock. \"We admire Michael Sam\u2019s honesty & courage,\" the NFL said in a statement released on Sunday, via Ian Rapoport of NFL.com. \"Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in NFL.\" Should any NFL executives or coaches with questions turn to Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about Sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates. The general manager of one NFL team told Peter King of Sports Illustrated that he believed Sam would not even be drafted after coming out. Meanwhile, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis contended that the leadership displayed by Sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster. The 24-year-old from Hitchcock, Texas revealed to both outlets that he had come out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the Tigers' 2013 campaign. \"At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,\" one of Sam's agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. \"He didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. \"They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn't ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.\" \"We\u2019re really happy for Michael that he\u2019s made the decision to announce this, and we\u2019re proud of him and how he represents Mizzou,\" Pinkel said in a statement. \"Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he\u2019s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn\u2019t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we\u2019re all on the same team and we all support each other. If Michael doesn\u2019t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way he has the type of season he put together.\" Sam recounted for The New York Times the moment when he came out to his teammates during a team-building exercise at preseason practice last year. A 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior who was voted co-defensive player of the year in the vaunted Southeastern Conference for the 2013 season, Sam made his announcement just two weeks before the NFL Scouting Combine begins on Feb. 22 in Indianapolis. I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! \u2014 Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014 Wanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out. Shout out to my former Teammate Michael Sam. Though its old news to us its a Great move by a great guy. Wish u much success in the future! \u2014 Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014 One of Sam's former teammates at Missouri, Trey Hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on Twitter.

{"pred": "Americans Are Convinced Climate Change Is Connected To Stronger Storms, Poll Says The poll finds that 28 percent of Americans think Typhoon Haiyan specifically was caused by climate change. Another 32 percent said it was not, and 41 percent said they weren't sure. Although scientists can't say with certainty whether a specific storm was caused by climate change, rising sea levels make storm surges from hurricanes and typhoons potentially more deadly in coastal areas, contributing to increased destruction. According to the new poll, conducted after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines earlier this month, 55 percent of Americans think climate change is related to more frequent and severe natural disasters, while only 23 percent do not. Most Americans think climate change, and more frequent and severe natural disasters are linked, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll that also finds most think human activity is at least partially responsible for the changing climate. The poll shows that the vast majority of Americans think humans are contributing at least somewhat to climate change, but differ on just how much. Sixty-eight percent of independents said humans are at least contributing, but only 29 percent said they are the primary cause. Among Republicans, only 15 percent said that human activity is the primary cause of climate change, although a total of 53 percent said that humans are at least a contributing factor. In total, 70 percent of respondents said they think human activity is having at least some impact on climate change. But only 34 percent said human activity is the primary cause. Another 36 percent said human activity is not the cause, but contributes to climate change. Eighty-five percent of Democrats said humans are at least partially responsible for climate change, including 55 percent who said human activity is the primary cause. But Republicans and independents were less convinced. Only 10 percent of respondents said human activity is not contributing to climate change at all and 9 percent said climate change is not occurring. The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 14-15 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

{"pred": "How Trump won Florida Donald Trump\u2019s stunning win in Florida was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide on Tuesday: Despite losing big to Hillary Clinton in diverse, urban areas of south Florida, Trump dominated in every other corner of the state and outperformed past Republican candidates with older, white and blue collar voters. With more than 95 percent of precincts reporting, Donald Trump carried a 140,000 vote lead in Florida. | Getty How Trump won Florida Trump's Florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide. \"Trump didn\u2019t run a robust program in South Florida targeting the Hispanic community. You could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible,\" said Curt Anderson, top adviser to Gov. Scott, the chair of the pro-Trump super PAC. \"But when Gov. Scott won, he did so because he really reached out. If Trump had, we wouldn\u2019t be talking right now. He would have Florida in the bag. Maybe he\u2019ll win because of what\u2019s in the countryside, so to speak, or the Panhandle. But this is really doing it the hard way.\" One of Trump\u2019s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio, said the results showed that Clinton exceeded President Obama\u2019s margins in the Florida markets he won in 2012. But Obama only carried Florida by less than a point. Clinton\u2019s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. She won a stunning 571,000 more votes than Trump in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. She won three lesser markets: West Palm (a 44,000-vote lead); Gainesville (10,000 more votes) and Tallahassee (11,000 more votes). Despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s large margins in Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula\u2019s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest who pushed him over the top. Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state\u2019s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. Latino turnout in Miami-Dade and Orange County was just not enough for Clinton. But turnout was even higher in Republican areas. By the end of the night, Trump\u2019s lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent \u2013 far higher than recent elections \u2013 Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits. Trump began Election Day down by at least 57,000 votes to Clinton, according to results posted on the Florida Division of Elections website just after the last Florida polls closed at 7 p.m. Central Time. But after that, as Election Day votes poured in, Trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m. The Florida meltdown is a familiar story for Democrats still scarred by Al Gore\u2019s 2000 loss to George W. Bush in a razor close race. Though Obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state. Trump blew away records in the Tampa Bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted I-4 corridor that helps swing elections. In the counties composing the market, Trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over Clinton. In the Jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. He held vote leads of 144,000 in Naples-Fort Myers market, 126,000 in the Pensacola market, 83,000 in the Panama City market and 58,000 in the Orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the I-4 corridor. Florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. And poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked Trump. The spending was noteworthy because Trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on TV and get-out-the-vote \"ground game\" efforts. Instead, Trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of Florida \u2013 his second home where he owns the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago estate \u2013 and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment\u2019s notice in Florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously. Trump\u2019s strength was no surprise to Republican Party of Florida Chairman Blaise Ingoglia, who earlier in the day said Republicans had more energized voters who couldn\u2019t wait until Election Day to cast ballots. By 9:10 p.m., Trump\u2019s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over Clinton. It started to trend down. But not fast enough for the liking of Democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how Trump had lost Florida and therefore the White House. Trump\u2019s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him Florida. Trump\u2019s positions put him at loggerheads with the Spanish-language powerhouse network, Univision, which has studios in the same city as his Doral golf club. With nearly all precincts reporting,Trump carried a nearly insurmountable 134,000 vote lead \u2013 1.4 percentage points -- leaving Democrats crushed and Trump\u2019s team elated with a win that, at one point, they felt wouldn\u2019t come. The ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at Wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win Florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out Republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail. But while Clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward Trump. And whites are still a majority of Florida\u2019s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. And they vote in even greater numbers. Their outsized support counteracted the votes of Hispanics and blacks \u2013 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively. About 1 p.m., one source with Clinton\u2019s campaign said, the Democrats were worried. Republicans were crushing the vote in the Panhandle, Southwest Florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties. But the vaunted Obama machine in Florida was no machine without Obama on the ticket. Now Democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while Republicans keep voting. Sen. Nelson\u2019s team fears a showdown with Scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message. \"So goes Florida, so goes the country,\" said Florida\u2019s senior senator, Bill Nelson. \"Look at the Hispanics turning out. Often the Hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young Hispanics, they\u2019ll be voting for Hillary.\" \"The difference here is that Trump did far better than Mitt Romney did in almost every county on Election Day,\" Fabrizio said. \"I am so proud of this team! MAGA!,\" Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s Florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day \"tense and nerve wracking.\" Most major surveys also showed Trump losing the state \u2013 including exit polls on Election Day. In myriad ways, Trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom. \"This was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn\u2019t measure,\" said one Republican pollster who was surprised by Trump\u2019s numbers. \"The Trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. Well, they showed up on Election Day.\" Two weeks ago during a meeting at Trump\u2019s golf club in Doral, sources said, Wiles successfully made the case to Trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more Republican absentee ballot voters. Wiles, who managed Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts. The size of the vote was historic in populous Democratic strongholds like Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. Trump\u2019s campaign initially didn\u2019t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. He delayed advertising on television \u2013 a must for any other statewide candidate. And he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration. Clinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in the state heading into Election Day, energized by early vote results that showed Hispanic turnout exploding. Exit polls reinforced that optimism, showing Clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trends pointing her way. In early October, as Hurricane Matthew left part of the state damaged, Wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. She sounded the alarm and Trump made sure the money was reprogrammed. But even with all of the new Trump spending, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign began to surge. Black and Hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls. \"By 5 p.m., our voters showed again,\" the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. \"We felt pretty good.\" \"My theory is that no one can make it to the WH without the Latino vote. It seems @realDonaldTrump has a different theory. See you Nov 8th,\" Univision pundit Jorge Ramos wrote June 3 on Twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim \u2013 proven wrong in this instance by Trump \u2013 about the power of the Hispanic vote. \"We had the advantage in high-propensity voters and they didn\u2019t,\" Ingoglia said. \"But ultimately, this is a message to the establishment. It\u2019s an anti-establishment year.\" By Tuesday morning, Democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of Republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on Election Day. Nelson and other Democrats also expected Clinton to pad her margin with African-American support. Story Continued Below"}

The program, to be carried out in nearby Oakland, is meant to test a scheme called Universal Basic Income, or UBI. While it\u2019s far from mainstream acceptance, UBI is viewed by some as a means to provide workers with economic stability as an increasing amount of the world\u2019s labor is automated. However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent Oxford University study found that as many as 47% percent of jobs are at risk of being computerized (although another study found that number may be as low as 9%). \"I think we are moving towards a world with less job security,\" says Matthew Krisiloff, who is managing Y Combinator\u2019s UBI study. \"There\u2019s political consensus around it, and there\u2019s relative simplicity in the sense that it\u2019s just direct cash and you can spend it however you want.\" What is Universal Basic Income? Is anyone getting paid yet? Y Combinator\u2019s Krisiloff says the newfound discussion of a basic income represents a fresh attitude towards government welfare programs. \"I think part of the reason it\u2019s back in vogue is because people are more accepting of unconditional programs,\" he says. \"People are starting to think there are more cost effective, less paternalistic, hands-on ways to help.\" Why is it popular? In reality, it gets a little more complicated. Sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most UBI proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money \u2014 minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. Limits aside, the general point remains the same: (Almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions. Despite sporadic support on both sides of the aisle, UBI has historically remained on the policy fringes. Many worry that a basic income could reduce the incentive to work, slowing the economy. Another concern is whether providing a basic income is the best way to spend public funds that could be specifically targeted to certain groups in need, the model most welfare programs currently follow. No nation has implemented a universal basic income, but the idea has gained traction in a few countries. Sweden recently voted down an initiative that would have implemented a relatively generous basic income for adults on top of the country\u2019s existing social services, Britain\u2019s labor party is considering advocating for a basic income, Finland may implement a version of UBI next year, and a city in the Netherlands is also pursuing a basic income experiment . In its most pure form, a government would send all citizens a certain annual income to everyone, regardless of their salary, age or employment status, typically in installments throughout the year. The basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century . Some on the political left have supported UBI a tool to redistribute wealth to the poor and provide a means to improve people\u2019s quality of life, while some on the right have seen it as a way to make the existing welfare state more efficient while promoting individual choice and reducing \"welfare traps.\" Here\u2019s what you should know about UBI:"}
{"pred": "Here are 22 countries that are more gender equal than the United States: According to the 2013 Global Gender Gap report released on Oct. 24 by the World Economic Forum, that, unfortunately, is not the case. In fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the U.S. 22 Countries Where The Gender Gap Is Smaller Than In The U.S. As always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the U.S. -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done. 1. Economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs. Where the U.S. really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. And though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the U.S. ranked 6th for economic participation. But the U.S. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. For example, women make up just 18.3 percent of the 113th Congress. The Global Gender Gap Report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the world's population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nation's gender gap in four key areas: In a year that has brought us national conversations about working women, leaning in and whether or not the patriarchy is in fact \"dead,\" you might expect that all this talk signaled a real improvement for gender equality in the United States. 3. Political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years. Each country out of the 136 is assigned a score between 1 (total equality) and 0 (total inequality) for each of the 14 indicators. The scores are then averaged to determine the overall rankings. According to the report's authors, the index scores represent the \"percentage of the gap that has been closed between women and men.\" And of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a woman's life. For example, it is illegal in both Nicaragua and the Philippines for women to terminate a pregnancy. 2. Educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and women's access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education. 4. Health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates. This year the United States ranked 23rd and received a score of 0.7392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the U.S. ranked 22nd with a score of .7373.

{"pred": "We shoppers aren\u2019t to blame for food waste. Guess who is After deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. \"While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example.\" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco\u2019s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a \"must work harder\" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste. One such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it. Just in case you aren\u2019t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term \"food poverty\" would appear in every headline that contains \"supermarket food waste\", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities. Battalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem. If we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain. But a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man\u2019s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can\u2019t afford to eat good, fresh food. What\u2019s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system. L ast year, ast year, Tesco\u2019s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . If you\u2019re finding that figure hard to envisage, it\u2019s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco\u2019s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don\u2019t publish their waste figures, but let\u2019s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we\u2019d already know all about it. Tesco\u2019s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain\u2019s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain. Our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we\u2019ll consume, rather than focusing on what\u2019s in our fridges and larders day-to-day. There aren\u2019t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I\u2019d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now. Four decades on, it\u2019s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that\u2019s riddled with problems. When the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less? And don\u2019t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we\u2019re too \"time poor\" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates. The bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin. But sell-by dates \u2013 the progenitor of use by and best before \u2013 were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning. If the untouched remnants of last week\u2019s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely? Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning Undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms."}

But most conversations center on ballooning tuition costs, rather than a less well-known expense that strains the wallets of college students: textbooks. Still, students and experts following the trend say that the prices are becoming prohibitively expensive. And the high prices are beginning to discourage some students from purchasing textbooks for their classes, despite the fact that they realize it may hurt their grades. \"They've been able to keep raising prices because students are 'captive consumers.' They have to buy whatever books they're assigned,\" Nicole Allen, a spokeswoman for the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, told NBC. \"The textbooks market is broken and students are paying the price,\" Ethan Senack, a higher-education associate at US PIRG, told US News & World Report in 2014. \"[Students] can't shop around and find the most affordable option, meaning there's no consumer control on the market,\" Senack said. The US Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) conducted a survey of 156 different college campuses across 33 states and found that 65% of students decided against buying a book required for class due to its high cost. And 94% of those students acknowledged that they were afraid that the move would hurt their grade. They can, however, mitigate the rising cost of textbooks by looking for alternatives, such as buying used books and selling their books after the course has come to an end. Since 1977, the price of college textbooks has more than tripled the rate of inflation, meaning a 1,041% rise, according to NBC News, which cites Bureau of Labor Statistics Data. Some publishers contest the idea that textbook prices have risen exorbitantly, claiming that what may look like stark increases in percentages actually represent more modest increases in whole dollars."}

{"pred": "How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS? How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS? Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain. But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS\u2014also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease\u2014are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday. Editor\u2019s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology. The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system\u2014which he operates with his cheek\u2014and have around-the-clock care. What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease? What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease? Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference? One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true. How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS? Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century. An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one\u2014or at least better treatments? What is ALS\u2014and is there more than one form of it? Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm\u2014the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time\u2014even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier. Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet. Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type? He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur. It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons. It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology\u2014it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease. ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease\u2014and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.\u2014is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain\u2014as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both. One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time. It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease\u2014and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens. Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia. Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say. There is also primary lateral sclerosis\u2014PLS\u2014and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder. I don't believe that adds to longevity. The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy\u2014or progressive supranuclear palsy\u2014which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles. I would say probably less than a few percent."}
{"pred": "This New Shade Of Blue Was Accidentally Discovered By Chemists \"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment. Back in 2009, a lab full of chemists stumbled across a new pigment, more or less by sheer chance. After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists\u2019 brushes. This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200\u00b0C (2,000\u00b0F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\" So, what\u2019s so special about this blue? He added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. I realized immediately that something amazing had happened.\" Subramanian told Artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties. The paint manufacturers Shepherd Color Company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of YInMn blue. He added: \"Our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable.\" This pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. Additionally, unlike Prussian blue or Cobalt blue pigments, it doesn\u2019t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic \u2013 that's always a plus. Not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light. The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. [H/T: Mental Floss]"}
{"pred": "Blocking Blue Light Helps Sleep A study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group. Being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age. While nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night. The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well documented, and have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years -- with good reason. Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease. If you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark. Lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light: Get light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes. This area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you: Limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether. Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency. Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures: In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources. Their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished. Patients were sleeping more during the night. Their sleep quality had improved. The number of subjects who met the criteria for \"poor sleepers\" had decreased."}

Probably left over from a lost civilisation.' On the red planet, one of the most famous is the 'face on Mars' spotted by one of the Viking orbiters in 1976. 'I think they are looking for anything out of the ordinary, and our minds like to see patterns in things. Given the thousands of images of Mars, you are bound to find something that looks a bit unusual,' he told MailOnline. But Nigel Watson, an alien expert and author of the UFO Investigations Manual, is sceptical of the bottle find. 'We find trash, tools, machine parts, bits of paper, as well as sculpture and carved stone tablets. I tend to see artifacts on the Martian surface as part art gallery and part garbage dump.' In December last year, Nasa's Curiosity rover took footage that appeared to show a large spoon on the red planet's surface. The bizarre bottle shape appears to have a red, green and white label and even a cork or cap at the end. One user commented: 'We see what we want to see.

Vigilante Mars 'anomaly hunter' Thomas Miller, 64, spotted the strange shape while he was sifting through Curiosity's latest snaps of the red planet. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places. And some users were amazed at the discovery - one said: 'Wow, it couldn't possibly be natural, could it?' 'Usually clearer pictures or those taken from a different angle show that such anomalies are really rocks or tricks of the light.'  However, others were more sceptical, suggesting it could be an optical illusion. Other objects such as rings and gloves have also been found in recent years.

You may also be wondering why those subway vents on every block smell so much more putrid on a steamy summer day. Or how it is possible to smell a food cart from all the way down the street. But long-time city dwellers know the horror behind the mystique: those awful smells that dominate every daily commute to and from the office. New York City has the highest population density in the US, and with 8,550,405 people roaming the nation\u2019s melting pot, it\u2019s bound to get smelly. For travelers with the gleam of the Big Apple in their eye, nothing seems better than New York City in the summertime. To many, New York is the city of dreams, but you have to be willing to accept it for the good, the bad, and the smelly. So when you get stuck with one those incredibly humid days, smells become only more potent. The water in the air causes these odors to dissolve, trapping them longer than if it were a dry day outside. But even after most of this waste has been incinerated across the river, strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day. All this driving only adds to pollution and the greenhouse effect, causing the city to become warmer and smellier as time continues. With such an insanely huge number of people living in just one city, it should come as no surprise that there is also an insanely huge amount of garbage produced. The sheer amount of garbage isn\u2019t the only problem. There also has to be a way to get all of it out of the city. Diesel trucks carry garbage out of Manhattan 7.8 million times each year. Let this sink in: That\u2019s the same as driving around the earth 312 times, and that's just for one city. A census conducted in July 2015 showed that the city had a population density of over 27,000 people per square mile. To put that into perspective, the US, on average, holds only 80 people per square mile. That much combined body odor alone could be enough to scare anyone away. Although residents of the city produce 12,000 tons of waste every day, New York City doesn\u2019t have any of its own landfills or incinerators. Garbage piles up in dumpsters until it can all be taken across the Hudson River to be incinerated in New Jersey, or, if possible, recycled locally and overseas. It turns out the combination of heat and humidity allow bacteria to grow faster and smells to travel further.

{"pred": "Man Investigates A Strange Noise Coming From A Dumpster... And Makes A Stunning Discovery. Right away, he noticed two things. Five raccoons were trapped inside the Coonskin Park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he'd ever seen before. As to how they got stuck, James said, \"The dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn\u2019t reach the top to get back out.\" And that rare raccoon? Thinking quickly, James fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. He leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! They were free\u2014but that brought consequences. Retired West Virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast James Butler heard strange cries coming from a Charleston, West Virginia, dumpster on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. Curious, he investigated the sounds. Investigating strange cries emanating from a West Virginia dumpster sounds like the start of a horror movie. Chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. But James Butler might disagree with you there. James was strolling through Coonskin Park, a riverside sliver of nature located in Kanawha County, West Virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. Curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera... \"I'd been going through some stuff in my personal life, Maxine said, \"and I was kind of having a sad day, so I...sat by her and she came right up to me....she came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand.\" From there, the raccoon's life only got better. James had the right idea when he saw the albino raccoon: he took some photos, set him free from the dumpster, and let him go on his way. Hopefully others lucky enough to spot one of these beautiful beasts in nature take the same approach! He didn't really look like like his family members\u2014or like any raccoon James had ever seen! This trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. How rare, exactly? She sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, should've been trying to tear her head off if she got too close. But amazingly, that didn't happen. The albino raccoon had been \"a well-kept secret\" in Coonskin Park, according to Rodney Jones, chief of Kanawha's Park Police Department. And once James shared his pictures online, Officer Jones feared it would become the subject of the public's curious cameras... \"We try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don\u2019t try to feed them,\" he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases. \"I'd really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone\u2019s curiosity or stupidity.\" \"Now that the albino\u2019s getting publicity,\" Rodney said, \"I figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park.\" And people searching for a wild animal\u2014with a wild animal's instincts\u2014can be trouble. For part of her early life, Isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence. Because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project. Luckily, there was good news in store for her... \"She's so gentle,\" Maxine said. \"She spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...I just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness.\" Worse, the albino raccoon's appearance can make it a \"prize\" in the eyes of some people. Something special that needs to be captured or owned. Such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in Georgia... For a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that's a pretty glowing review! But the story of Isis only underscored the worry of Rodney Jones, the chief of Kanawha\u2019s Park Police Department... When Maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet. No wonder she was aggressive. Maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal. People like James Butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it's important to remember they're wild animals\u2014potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection. They're to be admired from afar! The Georgia Department of Natural Resources rescued Isis and delivered the raccoon to Maxine Rainey, below, director of the Georgia animal sanctuary, A New Hope. But both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause... The organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. Stunned by his find, James didn't forget the real trouble at hand\u2014these raccoons were stuck. Understandably, Isis was aggressive. Human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her. \"Since she was described as so aggressive,\" Maxine said, \"we were just going to hold her for a couple of days.\" But then what?"}

{"pred": "In conclusion\u2014drumroll, please\u2014I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years. It's hard to look at BuzzFeed without being reminded of your mortality. The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. And as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, BuzzFeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can. Some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch\u2014like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die\u2014but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks. If you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it: I repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks. First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London. I'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens. BuzzFeed has a handy quiz for that, too. I'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted. The last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip\u2014around 40 hours in total\u2014and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that. On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet Next, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example\u2014how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks. Here is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks: I whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries. Other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane. I decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra. But if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it. Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks. That said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?"}
{"pred": "Russell Wilson Listens To Gospel Before Kickoff So you\u2019re not listening to Drake, Eminem, or anyone like that before kickoff? With the Seahawks in the middle of training camp and only three days away from their preseason opener against the Chiefs, we had a chance to chat with Wilson about a recent commercial he shot with Bose for their QuietComfort35 headphones. Over the phone, the three-time Pro Bowler and Super XLVIII Champion talked about his unusual\u2014at least for your average NFL player\u2019s standards\u2014taste in music, the future of the Seattle Seahawks, and how married life is treating him. Russell Wilson is just about one of the most humble people you could ever meet. He\u2019s like Tim Tebow, but Wilson doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going back to baseball any time soon. At age 27 there is definitely more to come for the Seattle Seahawks quarterback. Not only does he have two Super Bowl appearances and a championship to his name, but he just earned another ring after tying the knot with Ciara. What did you make of the Hall of Fame Game being canceled? That\u2019s not for me to worry about. All I care about is our team winning; that\u2019s the only thing that matters. The rest will handle itself. That\u2019s my only focus, man. All that stuff like I said, I just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like I said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen\u2014how I get ready for the offseason, how I get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and Bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that. Before a game, I\u2019m always listening to gospel music. I\u2019m just so grateful on game day. I don\u2019t try to be all amped up. The NFL said they\u2019re going to teach referees to call questionable catches incomplete if they aren\u2019t 100 percent sure. You\u2019ve been a part of questionable catches, how do you feel about what the NFL is trying to do? You have one song to listen to before kickoff, what\u2019re you listening to? Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t get to play the whole season. Kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more. So we\u2019re looking forward to him being back out there on the field. He\u2019s gonna do a great job. There was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got Jimmy Graham last year. You guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and Jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games. How come his numbers went down? That\u2019s a great question. \"I\u2019m Gonna Be Ready\" by Yolanda Adams . That\u2019s probably my go-to song. Before a game, I\u2019m always listening to gospel music. I\u2019m just so grateful on game day. I don\u2019t try to be all amped up. I try to be calm as can be and just grateful that I can play the game. It\u2019s a special, special day, those days. How much did Marshawn Lynch mean to this team and your play? Our division, in my opinion, is one of the hardest divisions, for sure, the NFC West. So many talented players, so many talented teams. When you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the Rams twice a year, you go against the Arizona Cardinals twice a year, that\u2019s not an easy conference, but we try to...the ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week. That\u2019s a big part of my philosophy, and our team philosophy is just to go 1-0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens. It\u2019s gonna be a good commercial. I\u2019m not giving away too much, I want people to see it first. Kinda can\u2019t tell too much, but it was a great commercial. It\u2019s so much fun shooting those commercials, especially with Bose. They\u2019re very first class in everything they do, and I\u2019m a big music person, as you know. I listen to tons of music, and we always have music playing around the house, Ciara and I, but also on the field, too. I have the wireless headphones in the locker room and the training room, and we listen to music when we\u2019re watching film, all those things, so I\u2019m constantly just listening to music. I think it can bring me a sense of peace and allows me to cancel out all the noise. I just like focusing on the things I need to focus on. Your celebrity has reached new heights. From third-round pick out of college to a couple Super Bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league\u2014so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself? I think ultimately the NFL and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is. That\u2019s the simplicity of it. It\u2019s not that complicated. I think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well.

I think it was the right decision in terms of players safety. It always comes down to players\u2019 safety. Awh man, I don\u2019t pay attention to any of that stuff. I\u2019m just grateful I get to play the game of football. I\u2019m just grateful I get to take the God-given ability that God has given me and just spread it across to my teammates and for us to play together and try to hopefully win another Super Bowl, and that\u2019s kind of my singular focus. So I\u2019m just grateful, man. I\u2019m grateful that God has given me that opportunity. Marshawn\u2019s a great football player. He\u2019s always gonna be well respected across the league. Now, guys gotta step up, and we can\u2019t wait. We have a great team, we have a lot of great players. I\u2019m excited about the running back group that we have stepping in. Those guys are gonna do a great job, and we\u2019re looking forward to having a great season. Are you concerned the Legion of Boom won\u2019t last much longer with more free agency talks and contracts coming up for them? You were ranked 17th in the NFL Top 100. Where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year? So what is this Bose commercial looking like? In the last four years, you have faced a division rival in the playoffs. What\u2019s it like to face a team in the division in the postseason? I think the Legion of Boom is going to be great once again. I\u2019m excited about all the things that they\u2019re gonna do this year. Our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams\u2014you take it one day at a time. It\u2019s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet. She\u2019s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet. I\u2019m just grateful for that. Congratulations on the marriage, how is the married life?"}
{"pred": "Why I Won't Buy One Extra Box Of Kleenex For My Kid's School Supplies. Signed, A Frustrated Parent And let\u2019s talk about that list, shall we? I mean, who in their right mind thinks it\u2019s a good idea to request that our kids purchase Expo markers in bulk or boxes of Kleenex that should be supplied already? ESPECIALLY when those might not get used by my kids? Who thinks it should be my job to bring Ziploc bags to school? I\u2019m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let\u2019s all be honest here) I can afford more than that. And *gasp* what if someone other than my precious Timmy uses them? Well, then, haven\u2019t I done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee? So we started doing the school supply shopping this week. A daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive \"just this size\" binder. Now, we\u2019re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it. Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid\u2019s teacher\u2019s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by \u2013 how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let\u2019s see. I\u2019m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we\u2019re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers. I\u2019m frustrated that we can\u2019t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. Be frustrated with me for the right reasons. I put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. (Insert sarcastic eye roll here). More is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let\u2019s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids \"clean\" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the \"trash\" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for. Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it\u2019s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn\u2019t that extra $10 a little worth it? You think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the \"-augh\" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project. So, let\u2019s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren\u2019t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens? Yes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo. If you don\u2019t agree with something on the list and think it\u2019s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how. I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can\u2019t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don\u2019t learn as well then. We should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body.

After Rodgers emerged as a front-runner on \"The Bachelorette,\" ESPN made him an offer a few weeks into the season. \"Our talent office had Jordan on their radar for some time.

{"pred": "The real reason people write so much about Mad Men: you keep clicking Early on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice One of the most consistent criticisms of Mad Men from those who aren't Mad Men fans is that \u2014 sniffs derisively \u2014 it's only beloved by the coastal media elite, because it's about rich white people who live glamorous lives and work in advertising. Contrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday \u2014 but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development \u2014 and now they pretty much all do. I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire. But Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come \u2014 and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them. But the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us. This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content \u2014 far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle. Mad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general The media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice \u2014 if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods \u2014 at least for the people who cared about it. Mad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development \u2014 and now they pretty much all do In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up. Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five. To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times \u2014 a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run. Thus, there was a huge opening in the \"reading about TV on the internet\" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters. 4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done But, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between \u2014 especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey's Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the \"serious TV\" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren't a ton of other options. As my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle When Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day. 2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left When Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited. 1) Readers wanted to read about it Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing. That strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the AMC drama's series finale, with Vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author Michael Idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. (To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.) 5) Never underestimate passion 3) There just wasn't as much good TV on Though it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites \u2014 especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller."}
{"pred": "Legumes and pulses, including baked beans, kidney beans, chick peas, lentils and split peas, can help lower cholesterol levels. The verdict? Good news first! Eating more nuts, legumes, plant sterols (molecules found in plants) and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol. In our study, we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels, including increasing nuts, soy foods and plant sterols. High fat, low fat, no carb, more carb: when it comes to getting information on eating to manage high blood cholesterol, confusion reigns. We checked the most recent research from trials that tested the impact of specific foods on blood cholesterol.  The bad news? Discretionary foods (aka junk) raise blood cholesterol, especially bad cholesterol (called LDL). Eating less lowers it. In a review of 25 intervention trials, eating approximately 67g of nuts a day (about half a cup) led to a 5.1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for LDL. Do you know your blood cholesterol level? If you don't, ask your GP to check it. Over a third of Australian adults have high cholesterol. Plant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut: pre-made cholesterol, which is found in some foods like prawns, and cholesterol, which is made in your liver.  A meta-analysis of 32 randomised control trials, involving around 2,100 people, found bigger reductions in total cholesterol (a mix of good and bad types) and LDL cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil, rather than sunflower or soybean oil. In contrast, another trial randomly selected over 7,400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets: the Mediterranean diet plus extra-virgin olive oil, or Mediterranean diet plus nuts, or a control diet (low fat).  The data showed LDL cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day.  5. Avoid junk food  2. Eat plant sterols, margarines and spreads  The results of 26 randomised control trials (the gold standard of research trials), which included 1,037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels, were added together.  Pulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre. They lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways.  Plant sterols, or phytosterols, are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods, including nuts.  Researchers found total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil. It didn't matter what type of nuts people ate; the more nuts, the bigger the cholesterol reduction.  A review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 8-10 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol. When it comes to heart disease risk factors, get your cholesterol and blood pressure checked next time you see your GP. 1. Eat legumes  The soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut, while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel. This 'competition' process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood. The reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with. Switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol. A review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised LDL (a type of LDL), with no significant effects on total or LDL cholesterol. 4. Use olive oil  3. Eat nuts  The type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important.  People with higher LDL cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement.  They are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines, spreads or milk. After 4.8 years follow-up, those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls. A big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 51, 000 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2010).  The most recent Australian Health Survey found fewer than one in five Australians ate them on the day of the survey. Olive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat. Olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat. Nuts are high in protein and fat, but the amounts of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat vary.  The benefits of making these changes? They lowered their cholesterol, lost weight and lowered their blood pressure. Legumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods. This means you tend to eat less when they're part of a meal. In a recent trial, 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 4.5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks, and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks.  One caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories (1600kJ), so you need to eat nuts instead of another food, or eat less each day but have them every day. But the biggest change people made was cutting back on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (junk foods) and eating a wider variety of healthy foods.  Those who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 7-8% lower risk. You can check your diet quality using our Healthy Eating Quiz. More than 80 percent of olive oil's healthy compounds (called phenolic compounds) are lost during the refining process, so less refined varieties, such as virgin olive oil, are a better choice. This is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram (large) can of baked beans. After four years of follow-up almost 11,000 people had a heart disease 'event'."}

{"pred": "Giant Whales Found Dead In Germany. You Won't Believe What Killed The... However, the details of the animals' necropsy that was released shows a very gruesome truth as to how the whales dyed to begin with. Scientists were very concerned and deeply disturbed as to what they found inside the unfortunate whales. It is very important thing to note that the young whales did not die due to the plastic in their stomachs. In fact, according to National Geographic, the whales had died due to heart failure. This was a consequence of them mistakenly swimming into the North Sea, most likely in search of squid, but then not being able to support the weight of their own body's in such shallow water. As an unfortunate result, the whales internal organs had collapsed. As of January 29th, just on the shores around the North Sea, sperm whales were found stranded in the shallow area that is not meant for marine wildlife. Wadden Sea National Park located in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well.

{"pred": "Pew Report Reveals Who's Likely To Get Married More Than Once Good news for romantics: The divorce rate may be dismal, but remarriage is on the rise. According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\" Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others. But don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux. \"Maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. \"But I think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\" \"There's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage.\" The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013. There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.) While today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family. Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy. Age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position. A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle. \"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said. Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two. Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry. Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts. Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again."}

{"pred": "The Biggest Mistake You're Making In The Bathroom \"Men don't have to do much more than unzip their pants to take a pee, and they might simply feel like going to the bathroom is so insignificant as to not even merit a hand washing,\" he writes to HuffPost in an email. The simple step is something many consider unnecessary in communal spaces, from your office restroom to bar bathrooms. Some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they're washing their hands. Seventy percent of people confessed to sometimes rinsing without soap, and 81 percent said they had witnessed a \"non-washing event\" in a public restroom within the past year, according to a 2013 survey by Bradley Corporation, which happens to be a manufacturer of bathroom products. Again, men were the grossest offenders: Only 60 percent said they always washed their hands after using a public bathroom, compared to 74 percent of women. Men were 2.5 times as likely to say they \"didn't feel the need.\" Michael Sykes, founder of the humor site the International Center for Bathroom Etiquette, says that the act of peeing is so easy for men that it may not register as a way of spreading germs. When researchers hid in a public restroom in a Michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. The average handwashing time? Six seconds, far short of the CDC's recommendation for a 20-second scrub. Men were more than twice as likely as women to leave without washing up. Handwashing can protect against both, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We should be doing more of it throughout the day, but it's our bathroom handwashing habits that have been carefully studied -- and they are disgusting. \"Men are less concerned about things,\" study author Carl P. Borchgrevink, an associate professor at Michigan State University, tells The Huffington Post. \"They're not as thoughtful and they don't like to be told what to do.\" Men also seemed to think they were clean if they were dealing only with their genitalia. \"Many men suggested that unless they had a bowel movement, there would be no need for washing their hands,\" Borchgrevink says. For those who need a refresher, here's how to wash your hands correctly: It's a good time of year to reflect on our handwashing habits. Flu season is here, and enterovirus D68 has spread to all but three states in the continental U.S."}

{"pred": "Is Clinton headed for a landslide win? Here\u2019s one reason it could happen. To be clear, Trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting Republican voters in the home stretch. It seems very likely to tighten. External events or new Clinton revelations could still shake things up. But the conventions are over, and the Clinton team \u2014 operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own \u2014 appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about Trump\u2019s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job. With a healthy assist from Trump himself, of course. The other day, New York Times polling analyst Nate Cohn laid down a useful marker for gauging whether the conditions are taking shape for Hillary Clinton to crush Donald Trump in a landslide. Cohn noted that the GOP nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of Republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them. \"Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him \u2014 worse still, many don\u2019t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,\" Cohn wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can\u2019t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.\" * CLINTON HOLDS WIDE LEAD IN VIRGINIA: A new Washington Post poll finds that Clinton leads Trump in Virginia by 52-38 among registered voters and by 51-43 among likely voters. Note: The poll also finds that Trump is viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of women and 70 percent of white college graduates. 1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes to an end View Photos Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. * CLINTON PREPARES FOR SLIME-FEST DEBATE: Politico\u2019s Annie Karni reports that the Clinton team is preparing for the absolute worst at the debates with Trump: This basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race. It regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked. While this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it. And this core imbalance goes deeper: Only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party. The new NBC News/Survey Monkey Tracking Poll finds Clinton leading Trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41. Even more crucially, Clinton is demolishing Trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say Clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say Trump does. Today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape. Never Trump conservatives and Democrats both agree that the GOP\u2019s nomination of Trump provides a unique opportunity to tarnish the GOP among a whole new generation. Speaking in Warren, Mich., on Aug. 11, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton outlined her vision for the U.S. economy. (The Washington Post) But this general finding shows up in other polls, too. A recent Washington Post/ABC News survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of Republicans agreed that Trump is \"not qualified to serve as president,\" while 74 percent said he is qualified. Among all adults, 61 percent said Trump is not qualified. Meanwhile, the Post/ABC poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of Republicans say Trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall Americans said the same. For Clinton, the percentages of Democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them. Have we mentioned that this election is becoming a referendum on Trump\u2019s fundamental unfitness for the job? Fewer than one in five Republicans believe Trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president. (By contrast, 39 percent of Democrats say that about Clinton.) Now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply. What\u2019s always missing from Trump\u2019s account is that Clinton was more hawkish than Obama was. Meanwhile, Kessler\u2019s interview with author Joby Warrick explores all this in more detail. The person picked to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of Vincent Foster, label her as a rapist\u2019s enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers....one of the key components of that prep...is finding a person who can stand in as Donald Trump during mock debates and launch personal attacks...that will make the real Trump look tame by comparison. Walt Purnell, 71, a retired business executive from Ashburn, had hoped to vote for Jeb Bush \u2014 or John Kasich. Or Marco Rubio. Or Chris Christie. But Trump? No way. \"I think he\u2019s a failure, I think he\u2019s a fraud, I think he\u2019s a con artist, I think he\u2019s insane,\" Purnell said. * TRUMP MAY COST GOP A GENERATION OF VOTERS: Trump is getting slaughtered among younger voters. Michael Gerson reflects on the reasons for this and its potential consequences: * QUOTE OF THE DAY, EVERYONE-HATES-TRUMP EDITION: The Post write-up of the new Virginia poll includes this gem from a Republican-leaning voter in the state: Cue up a fresh round of commentary claiming that Trump\u2019s \"street fighting\" debate style should make Democrats very, very afraid \u2014 even though thus far it has been a buffoonish failure. * TRUMP WOULD PROBABLY SEND TROOPS TO MIDEAST: The New York Times makes a good point about Trump\u2019s big foreign policy speech yesterday: But note Trump\u2019s numbers among Republicans on the temperament question: Trump\u2019s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad. It\u2019s a scam. It\u2019s another fundamental Trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch. This is false and facile. The terror group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003....At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton\u2019s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS. * CLINTON OWNS THE AIRWAVES: Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and the First Read crew serve up these striking numbers: Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign...has spent $61 million over the airwaves, while pro-Clinton outside groups have chipped in an additional $43 million. That\u2019s a combined $104 million in total ad spending for Team Clinton. But in that same time frame, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign still hasn\u2019t spent a single cent on a general-election ad, with two pro-Trump outside groups coming to the rescue with $12.4 million over the airwaves. That\u2019s a nearly 9-to-1 advantage in ad spending. * TRUMP\u2019S POLICY GIBBERISH: Trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism. CNN analyst Peter Bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best: This once again suggests that Trump\u2019s failure to broaden his appeal is putting him at a major disadvantage in states that are supposed to be very close (as Virginia was in 2012). * TRUMP\u2019S BIG LIE ABOUT ISIS: Trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that Obama policies were the chief cause of ISIS. Glenn Kessler corrects the record: Though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication. The kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates \u2014 along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law \u2014 would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones. Younger voters are less likely than other age groups to regard racially inclusive language as \"politically correct.\" They are less likely to believe in \"reverse discrimination\" and to embrace anti-immigrant attitudes....Young people understand the logo of the Republican nominee...as conveying a message of exclusion. These are the first serious political impressions of my younger son, voting in his first presidential election this year. It is the way to lose a generation. This seems unworkable. For example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? Also, Trump didn\u2019t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. But France has a serious domestic terrorism problem \u2014 would French citizens be subjected to this kind of test?...In short, Trump didn\u2019t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the State Department about how to approach this issue. The idea is really an effort to repackage Trump\u2019s Muslim ban as somehow being in sync with American values.

And, as the Guardian notes, both of \"the leading candidates for president \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why.\" While the legitimacy of taxes as a concept may be up to personal interpretation, what matters in Clinton\u2019s use of the so-called Delaware loophole, in particular, is her constant harping on the need for corporations and elite individuals to pay their fair share. In other words, Clinton\u2019s employment of North Orange Street amounts to a telling,. And, as the Guardian notes, both of \"the leading candidates for president \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why.\" Still, Clinton\u2019s constant moralizing on tax transparency \u2014 and her spokesperson\u2019s claims she hasn\u2019t benefited from the North Orange Street address \u2014 proves, yet again, her stances offer little in the way of a solid foundation. \"Some of you may have just heard about these disclosures about outrageous tax havens and loopholes and superrich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere,\" Clinton \"We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America.\" Clinton told the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO annual Constitutional Convention earlier this month. Reportedly dozens of Fortune 500 companies \u2014 Coca-Cola, Walmart, American Airlines, and Apple, to name a few \u2014 use Delaware\u2019s strict corporate secrecy laws and legal tax loopholes by registering the North Orange Street address for official business. \"a magnet ... which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes,\" as a Delaware\u2019s incredibly business-friendly structure that allows for such a crowded address is completely legal, though the ability to create shell corporations lends to shady dealings and isas a report by the Institute on Taxation and Foreign Policy has described. Of the 515 companies Trump officially registered with the Federal Election Commission, \"We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware,\" the billionaire told the Guardian, \"meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks. I don\u2019t feel guilty at all, OK?\" \"famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax.\" This brick-and-mortar, nondescript two-story building in Wilmington, Delaware would be awfully crowded if its registered occupants \u2014 285,000 companies \u2014 actually resided there. What\u2019s come to be known as the \"Delaware loophole\" \u2014 the unassuming building at 1209 North Orange Street \u2014 has become, as the Guardian described According to Neate, a Clinton spokesman explained, \"ZFS [Holdings, LLC] was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.\" \"Big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels, and worse \u2014 all have turned up at the Delaware address in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks,\" the New York Times\u2019 Leslie Wayne \"It\u2019s easy to set up shell companies here, no questions asked.\" the\u2019 Leslie Wayne described in 2012. In fact, some have claimed \u2014 all revelations of Panamanian documents aside \u2014 the use of tax-friendly locations inside the U.S. makes it the biggest tax haven in the world, with Delaware, alone, costing other states some $9 billion in lost taxes over the past decade. Clinton has repeatedly touted the needs for tax transparency and to shut down foreign havens with similar loopholes. Oh, the irony. As Rupert Neate explained for the Guardian, being registered in the tiny state allows \"companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of state.\""}

In addition to streaming video, it also includes free two-day shipping on many goods sold by the online retail giant and access to Kindle's lending library. That price went up from $79 last March. If you have Amazon Prime, you officially no longer need your roommate's mom's neighbor's HBO Go password to finish your \"Sopranos\" binge-fest. \"The Sopranos,\" \"Six Feet Under,\" \"Deadwood\" and many other HBO classics will be made available to subscribers of Amazon Prime on May 21, the two companies announced Wednesday. HBO signed a deal with Amazon to make its archive of television programs available for streaming for Prime customers. This is the first time HBO content has been available on an online-only streaming service. HBO Go is also coming to Amazon's new $99 streaming media player, Amazon Fire, by the end of the year. This deal could be a blow to Netflix, which has been in competition with Amazon's streaming service since its inception. Last August, Netflix snatched up an exclusive streaming deal with The Weinstein Co. for its movies, including \"The Artist\" and \"The King's Speech.\" Both Amazon and Netflix have also released their own original shows to entice new subscribers. The main catch is that only shows that have been out for three or more years will show up on Amazon Prime. Older shows like \"The Wire\" and \"Big Love\" will be available in their entirety, while the newest seasons of \"Girls\" and \"Veep\" won't be available for three more years. The only way to stream seasons broadcast in the past three years is through HBO Go, which is only available to HBO subscribers saddled with an expensive cable package. One twist: Certain tentpole franchises in the HBO universe, including \"Game Of Thrones,\" \"Sex and the City,\" \"Entourage,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" are not part of the Amazon deal, Re/code reports. These series are apparently just too popular for HBO to give up. Don't have Prime or HBO Go and still want to watch classic HBO shows?

The approximately 2,400-square-foot condominium, in a decidedly deluxe if architecturally nondescript full-service building and owned per property records by an investment banker who bought it in March 2005 for $2.45 million from retired Italian racecar driver Mauricio Flammini, has an open-plan layout that includes an unusually spacious and arguably space-wasting foyer with stone tile floor materials, smooth paneled walls and half a dozen small closets and storage cabinets. The main living space stretches a generous 35 feet and combines the kitchen, dining and lounge areas. There\u2019s a wood-burning fireplace sheathed in hand set slate tiles, and the smallish but sleek kitchen accommodates a full-range of snazzy high-quality appliances, including an integrated espresso machine. An open-tread switchback staircase ascends to a jail cell-sized lounge that opens to a 200-plus-square-foot private terrace with outdoor shower space and panoramic city views from the Empire State Building to north and the new World Trade Center in the south.

{"pred": "Apple iPhone 7 Has Two Nasty Surprises Questions over supply remain and there is no doubt \u2019s new iPhones are already proving immensely popular. But two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iPhone 7 to regret their purchase... Yes there are good surprises in the new iPhones as well (most notably in the iPhone 7 Plus) but if you didn\u2019t buy an iPhone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea... Apple iPhone 7 Plus Has A Great Secret Feature iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's The Difference? All of which leaves me in two minds about the iPhone 7\u2019s biggest external changes and who they really help the most. iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference? The first concern comes courtesy of popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. The famously diligent test site ran the iPhone 7 through the durability tests and claims Apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens: Note: As JerryRigEverything has not tested the iPhone 7 Plus we cannot make assumptions here. Being the more expensive model, it\u2019s possible sapphire is still used there. And here\u2019s where it gets interesting, because Apple still advertises that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. Given the new iPhones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. I have put these claims to Apple and will update when/if the company responds. Then there are little cost cutting omissions. If sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iPhone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). Meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. Instead earphones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are just wrapped around a piece of card. The revelation comes after JerryRigEverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the Mohs\u2019 scale of mineral hardness. Previously his tests on the iPhone 6S confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iPhone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire. This despite the fact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prices were increased compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in every country.

{"pred": "While colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, Vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender. Certainly, there\u2019s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn\u2019t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian\u2019s two-spirits or India\u2019s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there. \"It\u2019s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,\" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events. For years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories. By 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student\u2019s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer. \"Some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they\u2019re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new,\" said Ms. Ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on L.G.B.T. issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls \"Beyond Binaries.\" \"But there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles,\" she said. \"Anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. To validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life.\" Among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked \"men\" or \"women\" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn\u2019t match someone\u2019s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student\u2019s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname. The change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records. In hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like \"ze\" and \"xe,\" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary. Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options \u2014 something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for \"custom\" alongside \"male\" and \"female,\" with some 50 options, including \"agender,\" \"androgyne,\" \"pangender\" and \"trans person,\" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version. Identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique. How does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person\u2019s biological sex, and sex referring to a person\u2019s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one\u2019s romantic interests). \"I don\u2019t even know what it was I was trying to show,\" Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh. Gieselman\u2019s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. \"They were very confused,\" Gieselman said, \"and still are.\" Ms. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university\u2019s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students\u2019 office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student\u2019s self-respect \u2014 and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today\u2019s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms. A decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer\u2019s first act upon being installed as the center\u2019s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community. On campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, P.C. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and \"P.G.P.,\" or preferred gender pronoun. (The most semantically obsessed still object to the word \"preferred.\") Gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use Rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she.\" \"They\" has become an increasingly popular substitute for \"he\" or \"she\" in the transgender community, and the University of Vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it. In September, the university\u2019s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include \"they,\" as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the English language is constantly evolving. Since 2009, 1,891 University of Vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for \"ze,\" 10 for \"they\" and another 228 for name only. Gieselman began spending time at Outright Vermont, a trans and queer youth center where the gender lexicon of activists and academe is widely accepted. \"As soon as I learned about a genderqueer identity, I was like, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s the one!\u2019\" said Gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. \"Before, it had been really difficult to explain how I was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. Suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey.\" The university allows students like Gieselman to select their own identity \u2014 a new first name, regardless of whether they\u2019ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun \u2014 and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips. So far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the Consortium of Higher Education L.G.B.T Resource Professionals, and hundreds more have contacted Vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice. It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont\u2019s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch. \"At the time, it irritated me to no end,\" said Ms. Miller, a social worker. \"I was like, \u2018Really? This is what our struggle is going to be about? Pronouns?\u2019\" Bowing to the faculty, the task force selected \"ze\" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for \"name only,\" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun. \"Students proposed \u2018they/them\u2019 pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,\" Mr. Williams recalled. \"They said, \u2018You don\u2019t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.\u2019\" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was \"ze\" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun \"sie,\" with \"hir\" replacing \"his/her.\" One key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center. While in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, \"Honey, are you gay?\" Although Ms. Miller tries her best to always use \"they/them\" pronouns, she often slips up, but Gieselman isn\u2019t bothered. \"Rocko and I have an understanding. She knows I try,\" said Ms. Miller, slipping up again. Sara Miller, Gieselman\u2019s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed. But Ms. Miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. \"It\u2019s grown out of the process of really seeing how Rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how Rocko is their own person, and not a child,\" Ms. Miller said. \"This is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. That group knows Rocko only that way.\" Being a boy didn\u2019t feel right, either: \"I had a couple months where I gave it a go. I tried to bind my chest with an Ace bandage every day. I wore some masculine clothes and told my friends to call me Emmett.\" Neither category applied. \"It felt not only like I was invisible but, especially at that time when hormones are aflutter, like no one would really know what I was like for the rest of my life.\" At last summer\u2019s orientation for new faculty members, Ms. Brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the L.G.B.T. Resource Center at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. She also gave out her cellphone number and words of support: \"If you\u2019re struggling with it, give me a call any time and I\u2019ll walk you through it, and give you time to practice, and walk you through any questions you might have.\" Use of \"they/them\" is so widely accepted in the politically correct enclave that is Burlington that a colleague at Feldman\u2019s Bagels, where Gieselman works part time, recently asked if it was O.K. to correct a customer who uses the wrong pronoun because she knew Gieselman wouldn\u2019t. Gieselman leaned forward off the futon, swished the cards around, plucked one from the center, smiled, then read it aloud: \"Freedom.\" Robyn Ochs, an educator who helped found an early L.G.B.T. faculty and staff group at Harvard, believes that Vermont\u2019s changes are nothing less than lifesaving. \"Do you want to pick one?\" Gieselman asked me. I reached in the bowl and pulled out \"strength.\" At the apartment that afternoon, Gieselman talked excitedly about finally receiving documentation of a legal name change, which arrived in the mail that afternoon, and showed off several gig posters brought home by a roommate, who manages local bands. On the coffee table, a collection of Angel Cards filled a small bowl, each billet offering a single word like \"discernment\" or \"balance\" or \"integrity,\" meant to be chosen and read for a daily dose of inspiration. \"I know if something might be bothering them, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily say something about it,\" said Alexa Ciecierski, a morning-shift co-worker. \"Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,\" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties. \"I said, \u2018Well, yeah, but only with Anita,\u2019 \" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner \u2014 32 years and counting.) \"That\u2019s how clueless I was,\" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Cafe\u0301 in downtown Burlington. \"I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.\""}
{"pred": "Some things never change: 1996 career advice that's still solid Until that point, I\u2019d only worked in retail and had no idea what to expect. I asked my father and a professor for advice. Remarkably, 20 years later much of that guidance still resonates. The concept that employees should \"skill up\" to remain competitive has been around for several decades, and in the last years of the 20th century, companies had dollars to spend on tuition reimbursement and courses like Dale Carnegie. In 2016, training opportunities are scarcer and more varied (online, in-person, etc.), but they should still be coveted. It\u2019s only a matter of time before individuals will be responsible for 100 percent of their professional development. Early in my career, I made the mistake of churning out work product that no one ever saw. I didn\u2019t get ahead until I made sure my managers were aware of how my contributions were impacting the bottom line. Today\u2019s emphasis on lean teams and productivity means that adding and communicating value is more important than ever. Be humble and willing to learn from any task Take advantage of company-sponsored training opportunities Dress for the job you want Like business culture, business dress was once straightforward. Junior level professionals in the 90s could wear business casual, which consisted of khakis and polos for guys and slacks or skirts paired with nice blouses for women. However, by the time you reached a senior level, you were advised to take it up a notch with tailored suits and pricey shoes and accessories. Basing your appearance on that of the executives sent a very clear signal that you intended to climb the ladder quickly. And it still does \u2013 even if the executives in your company now wear jeans and Hollister tee-shirts. Corporate culture used to be \"one-size-fits-all.\" If you worked in a business office in any city in the world, you were expected to behave professionally, adhere to hierarchies, and generally do what you were told without making waves. Individual company cultures may be more unique today (conservative versus liberal, strict versus playful) but the need to examine and then fit into a new culture \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 remains. Losing your cool at work has always been frowned upon, and despite claims of a kinder, gentler 21st century workplace, it still is. And now, the stakes are higher because your epic in-office rant won\u2019t just be a legend passed down from employee to employee. Instead, it could be taped on a phone and broadcast on social media for perpetuity.  In the 90s, if your boss asked you to grab coffee or make copies, you did it with a smile. You understood that you were paid for the privilege of watching and learning as the higher-ups did the real work. Today, those with little experience may feel empowered to say no to grunt work, but that doesn\u2019t mean refusal is a smart idea. Human nature hasn\u2019t changed and humility will get you everywhere.  In the summer of 1996 after my sophomore year of college, I started an internship at a nonprofit technology association in downtown Washington, D.C. Success is not about effort, it\u2019s about visibility and value Back in the day, we arrived exactly on time for interviews. We asked politely for networking conversations and check-in meetings with our bosses that fit into a half hour slot in the day planner. When we thought people were busy then \u2013 filing paperwork, sending faxes, and leaving voicemails \u2013 we had no idea what we were in for. In 2016, people are so overscheduled and frazzled that they take their iPhones to the bathroom. If you make them wait, they might just lose it.s In a new situation, aim to assimilate In the late 90s, these were physical doors rather than virtual ones, but the concept is the same. When applying for a job or looking to connect with someone, name-dropping would increase your odds of getting a positive response. Today, although we have exponentially larger networks thanks to social media, deep, in-person relationships still provide the greatest networking benefit.  Doors open based on who you know Workplace gossip has been a \"thing\" since biblical times, and in 1996, the chief concern was that if you told a colleague a secret or rumor in confidence, that individual would share it with someone else and it might be heard by the wrong person. Never has this advice been more critical than today, when, thanks to the speed and ease of digital communication, your secret WILL be heard by the wrong person \u2013 guaranteed. A bad attitude will break your reputation As you build your network of contacts, remember to follow up If you want to keep a secret, don\u2019t tell anyone Meeting a contact once is a wasted opportunity unless you periodically remind him or her of who you are and take steps to grow the relationship over time. In the 90s, I was encouraged to send snail mail holiday cards to former bosses and colleagues, and even to pick up the phone occasionally. Twenty years later, it\u2019s all about LinkedIn.

Indeed, officials say it would take around 11 years to examine every single exhibit. Wander on the vast Palace Square beforehand. 12. The Victoria & Albert Museum The Unesco heritage Museum Island comprises five conveniently adjacent museums, all located on an accessible \"island\" along the river Spree. Each museum is a destination in its own right and deserves at least half a day to explore. The Pergamon Museum has vast treasures from the Ancient Near East and Islamic art, though the Pergamon Altar, north wing and gallery of Hellenistic art are closed to the public until 2019 due to refurbishment; the Neues Museum holds Egyptian, prehistoric and classical treats, while the Bode Museum has an outstanding sculpture collection. Combination tickets are available for all five museums. The museum opened its second branch last year in the City of Broken Dreams - Hollywood. The new collection of items studying failed relationships and their ruins follows in the footsteps of the original one in Zagreb, promising to take visitors on an emotional journey through a showcase of 115 unwanted artefacts from relationships past, exploring the \"love, pain, drama, irony, humour and reconciliation\" of break ups.  11.

Museum director highlights: Prado Museum With a collection of some 6,000 historical musical instruments to choose from, MIM can put on a show of astonishing range and quality. Three other factors work in its favour: the museum is housed in a beautifully renovated Art Nouveau building, formerly a department store; headphones bring the musical instruments alive; and the view over Brussels from the rooftop restaurant is unparalleled. But there is also plenty of local talent, including medieval Brussels tapestries, retables (sculptured altarpieces), and Art Nouveau objets d\u2019art. They are housed in buildings originally designed for the 1880 international exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of Belgian nationhood. The surrounding Parc Cinquantenaire also has a military museum, and an impressive collection of antique cars called Autoworld. Described as a \"genuinely touching window on the human soul\" by Telegraph Travel\u2019s Chris Leadbeater, the brilliant attraction showcases a bizarre collection of objects connected to romances that are no more. Subtly illustrating the tragic-comedy that is love, it is now one of Zagreb\u2019s most visited museums. One of the greatest museums in the world, the Prado displays superb works by Spanish masters such as Vela\u0301zquez, El Greco and Goya, but has wonderful Italian and Flemish collections, too, with paintings by Raphael, Titian and Tintoretto, Bosch and Rubens. There are usually at least two temporary exhibitions running as well. Housed in a neo-classical building with a lovely roof-terrace cafe, this museum traces Greek art right up the 20th century. Sculpture, ceramics, jewellery, paintings, furniture and costumes are on display, but top pieces include the Thessaly Treasure (a hoard of gold filigree jewellery set with precious stones, dating from the second century BC), two early paintings by El Greco, and the reconstruction of two 18th-century, wood-panelled, Ottoman-inspired living rooms. More of the tortured artist\u2019s paintings and drawings are collected here than anywhere in the world, and the temporary exhibitions of associated works are usually inspired and engrossing. The Oxford Dictionary of Architecture calls Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum \"one of the most complex, intricate, and ingenious series of interiors ever conceived\".

Mus\u00e9e Marmottan-Claude Monet Monet, Lautrec, Koons, Bacon: the secret world of artist studios Inaugurated in June 2009, this light, airy glass-and-concrete building was designed by Swiss architect Bernard Tschumi. Archaic and classical finds from the Acropolis site are displayed here \u2013 proud statues of the ancients and life-like stone carvings of animals. The top floor is devoted to the marble frieze that once ran around the top of the Parthenon. About half of the pieces are originals, while the remainder are white plaster copies. The missing pieces were removed by Lord Elgin in 1801 and are now in the British Museum in London. The Greeks have wanted them back for decades, and hope that this blatant presentation will finally convince the British to return them.  Japan's 'art island', tiny Naoshima boasts a disproportionate number of world-class installations, unexpected cultural distractions and world-class museums. In the latter category, Chichu Art Museum is built mostly underground - so as not to sully the island's largely unblemished beauty - and features vast exhibition spaces largely built to complement the artworks, by the likes of Monet and Walter De Maria, which they now house.  In the late 19th century, Belgium was a centre of Symbolism, producing work of haunting beauty and compelling weirdness. And then came the great surrealist Rene\u0301 Magritte, to whom a whole wing of the museum has recently been devoted. Other great names in the history of art are represented too, but it is the Belgians who make the deepest impression.  The man who created it all was a discriminating collector with the hoarding mentality of a pack rat and a horror of an empty space. Sir John Soane displayed his collections with an eye for decorative pattern and symmetry, and not, as is usual in art galleries, to distinguish what is historically or aesthetically important from what is not. 3.

Later generations made some worthwhile additions, such as Canova\u2019s risque\u0301 statue of Pauline Bonaparte. The mansion where Rodin lived at the end of his life now contains an unrivalled collection of the sculptor\u2019s work, arranged around its rooms and beautiful garden.

It begins with the Flemish \"primitives\", the late-medieval pioneers in oil painting, celebrated for their intense attention to detail. It then leads through Pieter Brueghel the Elder and the Younger to Rubens, master of dramatic composition, and Antony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens. The Getty Museum is spread over two lavish campuses. The most extravagant, the original Getty Villa in Malibu, is a modern recreation of a First century Roman villa built by oil tycoon J Paul Getty. The villa houses a world-class collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities. The Getty Center, which opened on a hillside in Brentwood in 1997 and cost $1.3 billion, looks more like a giant white pharmaceutical plant and houses a world class collection of American and European photographs, European art and furniture.

You can take comfort, too, in the science about vegan athletes, which generally shows that, as one recent scientific review concludes, \"a vegan athlete can compete effectively at a high level.\" Can athletes be vegans? My 15-year-old son has decided that he needs to switch to a vegan diet and practice calisthenics to get lean and fit. I think that he is already lean and fit at 140 pounds, 5-foot-10-inches, size 11 feet, and buff. I am not sure that going vegan is a good route. Who can educate us about his plan? Vegan athletes, like the bodybuilder Kenneth Williams, below, also may require supplements of B12, a vitamin found only in meat, and possibly of calcium, she said, especially if they are young and growing. Interestingly, football players sometimes shy away from vegan diets, because it is hard to consume enough plant-based calories to add bulk. So you, your son and his coach might wish to consider whether he wants to be the most willowy player on the field and adjust his diet accordingly. Vegan athletes do need to be diligent about consuming sufficient protein, said Nancy Clark, a sports nutrition expert in Massachusetts and the author of \"Nancy Clark\u2019s Sports Nutrition Guidebook.\" Plants, seeds and soy provide protein but in a form that is less absorbable than protein from meat. So \"you need to eat a lot of it,\" Ms. Clark said. \"I have clients who say, \u2018Oh, I put a few chickpeas in my salad.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to do it.

{"pred": "The inmate, Thomas McFadden, says returning to his old cell scared him. \"But I always wanted to go back to Bolivia, and there was always a strong connection between me and Rusty.\" In 2013, the story took an even darker turn when news spread of a 12-year-old girl becoming pregnant inside the jail, after an alleged rape by her imprisoned father and other men. Child welfare charities called for a ban on children living inside. It all began when Mr McFadden, a British-Tanzanian, was caught smuggling cocaine in La Paz airport in 1996 and found himself jailed in a place more like a warped small town than a prison. The story was immortalised in a best-selling book, Marching Powder, and now the book's protagonist - a former inmate - and author have reunited to return to the prison for a new documentary film. San Pedro Prison remains operational today, despite many plans to close it. For years, its tours were an open secret, but one day in 2009 a local television crew arrived to get footage for a story about a politician held inside. While waiting in the plaza outside, the cameramen caught a steady stream of tourists going in. \"As a conversation starter, we used to say we met in a Bolivian jail,\" she says from her new home in Sydney. She was 24 at the time and is 33 now. Their unusual relationship began when Mr Young joined one of the illegal prison tours that the inmate ran for foreign backpackers from early 1997 until his release. Prisoners were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cells as if they were real estate. There was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory. When Rusty Young and Thomas McFadden returned to the prison for their forthcoming documentary Wildlands, they happened upon one such tour group and snuck alongside them, incognito. The documentary Wildlands uses their story in San Pedro Prison as a launch pad for exploring all sides of the drugs trade, and includes interviews with former undercover US police agents and an assassin who was a right-hand man to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. It is 20 years since Bolivia's chaotic San Pedro Prison became a tourist attraction, a place where backpackers stayed for weeks and partied with inmates. After his release in 2000, he left those days far behind and is now a chicken farmer in Tanzania. However, his life-changing friendship with his \"brother Rusty\" has gone the distance, and he has even named one of his children after him. Armed with the footage, the Bolivian press ran with the story. The main concern locally was not the tourists but the alleged corruption of the authorities, who were thought to be taking a cut of the tours' profits. \"Who is watching the police?\" asked an editorial in La Razon newspaper. During the ensuing \"clean-up\", prisoners had their visitors' rights revoked for a day. A riot followed and around 80 children were evacuated. Rusty Young wrote Marching Powder in his twenties, when as a young backpacker from Sydney, Australia, he stayed in the prison, and later helped secure Mr McFadden's release by posing as an international human rights lawyer. Lydia Docking, a British traveller, went on not just one but repeated trips to the prison in 2008, led by a prisoner from Portugal. One of the other backpackers she met on her first day there later became her husband. Bolivia's San Pedro 'tourist prison', 20 years on Thomas then moved to Tanzania, and Rusty went back to Australia, where after the huge success of Marching Powder he had difficult-second-book syndrome. His novel Colombiano, about a teenager who gets drawn into a Colombian terrorist organisation, is due out later this year. Word had spread around local hostels that there was an English-speaking inmate who would show visitors around this strange microcosm. Large-scale tours of the prison are no longer possible. Today backpackers typically opt for La Paz walking tours, which stop outside the prison walls and tell Marching Powder's story. Centrally located in downtown La Paz, the prison became a tourist attraction that featured in Lonely Planet guidebooks. Travellers paid an entrance fee and, in some cases, opted to stay for weeks, partying with the inmates. Their San Pedro tour guide came to their wedding after his release, and although the couple has since separated, she still has their dog, named Pedro after the prison. \"I thought what is this place? I even had to pay my own taxi fare to get there,\" Thomas McFadden remembers today. \"They kept making factual errors, so I couldn't help asking smart-arsed questions,\" says Mr Young. Eventually an Irish traveller, who had just read the book, recognised the pair. \"He whispered, 'You're Rusty, You're Thomas!' And we sneaked off together for a beer.\" Back in 2000, the two men travelled to Colombia, after Mr McFadden's release. They found work as English teachers and worked on the book, which became a New York Times best-seller. Despite her jokes, she is acutely well aware of the darker side of the story. \"I'm still confused by it, still processing it,\" she says. \"Over the course of three weeks, we went most days. I sometimes question why. It was mostly just to share experiences and to understand how lives start the same but can take such different paths.\" As for the sequel to the book, perhaps that will come sooner. \"My publishers been harassing me about that for years,\" says Rusty. \"We already have a title: Marching On.\" But the long-awaited Marching Powder feature film may still be years away. The rights were acquired by Brad Pitt's production company but have since expired. Narcos director Jose Padilha has been linked to the screenplay, and Don Cheadle and then Chiwetel Ejiofor expressed interest in playing Thomas McFadden, but filming never got off the ground."}
{"pred": "\"Pluto\u2019s Little Sister\" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn\u2019t Makemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto\u2019s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto\u2019s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake. The dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon. Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake\u2019s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake\u2019s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake\u2019s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn\u2019t on Makemake\u2019s surface... it\u2019s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\" Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake\u2019s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden. Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system\u2019s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech\u2019s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.\" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more \"exotic\" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake\u2019s density and thus the densities of the materials it\u2019s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets. However, MK2\u2019s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake\u2019s past atmosphere. If MK2\u2019s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts. opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\"  The New, Improved Makemake System While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. \"This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,\" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us. Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake\u2019s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don\u2019t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker\u2019s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before. thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There\u2019s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they\u2019d made a major discovery. It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2\u2019s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake\u2019s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place. The Moon in the Data Finding a Dark Moon"}
{"pred": "3 Cities That Are Reportedly Being Considered For GTA 6 However, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any talk about where the next GTA game might take place. We look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment. There\u2019s been a few inklings so far. To name one, could Tokyo by the next blueprint for Rockstar\u2019s series? Maybe. Here\u2019s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that GTA 6 will surely be. With the existence of GTA 6 promoting more mystery and rumours than any other game out there at the moment, there is one thing that remains at the core of gamers and fans minds when thinking about a new installment. Where will it be set? Even though GTA 5 is still doing well online. It\u2019s forward that Rockstar will be looking. Where do you think the next GTA should be set? Let us know. There\u2019s also been a lot of rumours that Rockstar has abandoned development work on GTA 6 to focus more on Grand Theft Auto online but it\u2019s a given that the game will eventually come out. As mentioned above, Tokyo could definitely be in with a shot at the next prime GTA location. With it\u2019s intoxicating mix of tight streets and neon night-sky, it would showcase the visuals of the game and its graphical capabilities. A good indicator of this is by the different mods that have been released so far for the older GTA 5. It wouldn\u2019t be new to the GTA series, but it would make more a welcome return. It would also make sense to go back in time like Vice City did. If GTA returns to London, it would most likely be that of a different era. Especially in an updated fashion. It would also make sense being set in the U.S itself as GTA has also been a great parody of America as a country. Tokyo: Chicago: John Dillinger. Al Capone. Frankie Yale. The Windy City is known for its mirrored giant Bean sculpture as much as its violent past. Chicago used to be a town of blood and bullets and this would make a fitting context for a GTA game. London: It would also make sense in a story-sense as Tokyo has a criminal underworld led by factions of the Yakuza. But is this too similar to the Hong Kong of Sleeping Dogs? Even though that was set in China, it does seem aesthetically alike. It would still be an interesting shift from West to East, however. London would also be a perfect premise to stir up a lot more controversies that are common with the U.K and EU."}

The Professional Golf Association (PGA) has decided to not hold their PGA Tour event at Miami\u2019s Trump Doral resort. Instead, they will be moving the prized golf tournament \u2013 which has been held in Miami since 1962- away to Mexico City. It only took the New York real estate mogul and scam university pitchman four short years to destroy the relationship and lose the deal. Losing a title sponsor, whether of a sporting venue or event these days, defines common. Being unable to replace one, especially for a popular golf tournament with international reach and a half-century of history, defines uncommon. Even in the economically stretched times of 2009-10, the PGA signed lucrative sponsor agreements. Now, the tournament seems headed on the other side of a border on which Trump declares he wants to build a wall. The PGA needs a clean break from the sport\u2019s less than glorious past track record for racial relations after an era when Afro-American-Asian legend Tiger Woods was by far the top draw for the sport. Golf\u2019s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into America\u2019s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member\u2019s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, African-Americans, Latinos and Jews from many private courses. So it only makes sense that they\u2019re following NBC\u2019s lead in firing the shameless race-baiter from hosting one of golf\u2019s top events now that he\u2019s hurting the sport\u2019s cash flow with his radioactive remarks. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s golf resort business is going to be awfully lonely once six more months of his endlessly crass remarks of intolerance and hatred get plastered across the internet. Trump\u2019s open bigotry caused Cadillac to pull out as the title sponsor, and nobody else in corporate America wanted to touch Trump\u2019s signature golf course with a ten foot pole. Mexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas has picked up sponsorship when no American corporation would, and the television production and financial service behemoth got the golf tournament location they wanted in return: Mexico City. As the Miami Herald reports, it\u2019s highly unusual to be unable to replace a sponsor in America\u2019s televised professional sports leagues: The orange-faced one is surely red in the face with embarrassment and rage as Mexicans publicly make a loser out of the profane bigot who dreams of building border walls at Mexico\u2019s expense. There is little doubt that the racist Republican\u2019s presidential campaign has cost the vulgarian\u2019s company the prestigious PGA Cadillac Championship tournament at Trump Doral Resort, home to the famed Blue Monster. Donald Trump need only look in the mirror to see what\u2019s sad and wrong, because what\u2019s going on is Trump losing one of his golf crown jewels to Mexico due to his of stereotyping, hatred and bigotry. Trump handled the news poorly, blurting this out on a Fox News appearance: \"They\u2019re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance. But they\u2019re moving it to Mexico City. And I\u2019m saying, you know, what\u2019s going on here? It is so sad when you look at what\u2019s going on with our country.\""}

When she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories. The tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. She had Cushing's disease. If left undetected, it could have killed her. Lizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain, but it wasn\u2019t without psychological cost. So she did. But even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed.

{"pred": "Preferred haircuts for men are constantly evolving. Except for one particular style. Pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler! Check out the short but informative men's hair tutorial of achieving the most popular hairstyle in America.H/T - GQ Ask your barber to scissor-cut the top of your head to about an inch and a half, adding a bit of texture to the ends with a razor. Around the sides and back, have him use a clipper to taper the length down to about a quarter inch, or an eighth if you feel like going really short. Wavy hair? No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too! You could achieve a formal look by slicking the full part of your hair with a hairdryer and a Denman brush for volume. Spritz some hairspray to firm it up. The heavy-on-top style is juxtaposed with a side of cool, with facial hair and cool specs. Asymmetrical faux hawks give the appearance of playfulness. Get some gel and gather your hair up to one side with your fingers. Beau-haute! This gives the face a squared look, where the sides are blended straight up and the top is slicked back with no visible part."}

According to Lawson, there are tons of benefits to metcon workouts, including improved fat loss, increased calorie burn compared to steady-state workouts, muscular strength gains, and improved cardiovascular function. And one 2012 study in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism found that HIIT workouts boost metabolism better than cardio alone. When you first get going, Lawson suggests starting with just three of the exercises above instead of all four. Decreasing the number of total rounds you complete, as well as increasing the amount of rest time between each exercise, will allow you to work your way up to more intense workouts in a safe yet effective way, says Lawson. (Here's how to tell if your workouts class is too hard .) Rest for zero to 30 seconds rest between exercises, and zero to 60 seconds of rest between rounds. (The more fit you are, the less rest you\u2019ll need.) Repeat three to five times depending on your level of fitness. While there are tons of great metcon classes out there to choose from, you don\u2019t have to shell out tons of cash on a fancy gym membership to give this workout a try.

Two Dutch citizens were among 30 people on board the Arctic Sunrise, a Greenpeace ship, which was seized by Russian authorities last month after activists staged the protest at the Prirazlomnaya offshore oil platform. Greenpeace said the activists had been engaged in a peaceful protest in international waters to highlight the environmental risks posed by drilling in Arctic waters.

Battlefield 1 is looking set to break all kinds of sales records and this might finally be the year when it manages to dethrone the Call of Duty franchise from the number 1 position. The good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and I think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of EA is that the World War I theme is resonating with players out there.

Here we go: Now Watch How to Make Homemade Ketchup: One of the most prominent ingredients in ketchup? Sugar. It's so cloyingly sweet that anything it gets near tastes like it-even when you wipe it off with a paper towel (trust me, I've tried). I don't have to be too close to ketchup to know when it's around. It has that stinky tomato smell ... rancid even. And it lingers ... FOREVER. Hours. As a ketchup hater, you can imagine the disappointment and utter grotesque when you sit down at a restaurant, whether it's a dive diner or upscale bistro, and have to share your meal with a bottle of the red stuff. Or when you order fries, they arrive with ketchup, and you have to spend the next five minutes tracking down your waitress just to get the condiment you really want with fries ... mayo! Do you know how many delicious French fries I've had to enjoy with my eyes closed? So that I don't have to bite into them with a vat of liquid red staring back at me? Even worse, when the ketchup and fries arrive together, with a few of the fries touching the villain. I wish America's sweetheart could be something more interesting than ketchup, but alas, the numbers speak. While mayo still ranks as the most popular condiment in America, ketchup is a close second. And that's because there isn't anything we're not dousing it on. Eggs are one that hurt my heart, and don't even get me started on omelets. But beyond that, hash browns, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets all disappoint me in their own way. At least other condiments have signature textures: mayo is nice and creamy. Mustard is silky (kinda). But ketchup? It's gloppy as it messily squirts out of that squeeze bottle ... unless you didn't do a proper shake and you end up with a watery first squirt, which is the WORST. Nope, I'm not a Chicago native, but I do still think this is a sin. Mustard (maybe sauerkraut, too) on dogs only, never ketchup.

Jobs and his friend and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, had their first business: illegally selling so-called blue boxes that would allow people to break into the telephone system and make free calls. \"If it hadn\u2019t been for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple,\" he said in a 1994 video interview. \"I\u2019m 100 percent sure of that.

{"pred": "Eccentric Uncle Leaves Relatives Old Garage in His Will In 2009, the eccentric and brilliant uncle of a brother and sister in Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom passed away, leaving them the deed to a dusty old garage. You've probably heard at least one story about a crazy uncle leaving some pretty amazing, unexpected items to a relative, but this one has to beat them all. Apparently, the late doctor had been a hoarder, so the siblings assumed they were just tasked with cleaning up a huge mess, but when they opened up the garage door, they were shocked at what they found. The nephew who wished to remain anonymous also told Mail Online, \"We knew he had some cars, but we had no idea what they were. Dr. Harold Carr was a life-long eccentric and became a bit of recluse in his later years, so, while his family knew he kept cars, they had no idea what kind of vehicles he'd been collecting over the years. \"Since he died, it has taken me 18 months to get where I am today,\" the nephew said. He also added that his uncle, while a bit strange, was \"a very generous man.\" In his later years, the doctor was said to have suffered from a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and hoarded everything in the house he refused to leave. Files were piled six feet high at his home, and they even included receipts for pencils he purchased in the 1950s. The 1937 Bugatti Type 57S was found in the garage, amid piles of medical machinery, 1,500 beer steins, thousands of receipts and even a World War II spy drone. He also described his uncle, explaining that he was \"a very eccentric old gent,\" adding, \"I suppose you could call him a mad doctor. People who saw him in the street thought he was a tramp. He would wear two pairs of trousers at the same time.\" His nephew told The Mirror that. \"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure, and certainly no one knew what it was worth.\" \"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure. It's worth so much because he hasn't used it for 50 years. It was one of the original supercars. \"When it was built it could reach 130mph at a time when other cars could only do 50mph. Of course we are delighted and we're going to make sure the money is shared out among the family.

President Obama's brother, Malik Obama, says he plans to vote for Donald Trump in November. Photo: Peter Duke (left); Getty Images (right) Lately, family ties seem to be frayed. Obama, who was best man at the president\u2019s wedding, said he spoke to his brother a year ago and was miffed that he did nothing to help his own foray into politics when he ran for governor of the southwestern Kenyan county of Siaya in 2013. Barack Obama is seen with his half-brother, Malik. Photo: AP Obama, 58, a longtime Democrat, said his \"deep disappointment\" in his brother Barack\u2019s administration has led him to recently switch allegiance to \"the party of Lincoln.\" \"My brother didn\u2019t help me at all,\" said Obama. \"He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn\u2019t supported me at all.\" Obama plans to trek back to the US to vote for Trump in November. Obama used to live in Maryland, where he worked for many years as an accountant and is registered to vote there, public records show. The president\u2019s and Malik\u2019s father, Barack Obama Sr., left Kenya in 1959 when Malik was a year old and his mother was pregnant with his sister Auma. Obama Sr. enrolled at the University of Hawaii, where he met and married the president\u2019s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. Malik Obama didn\u2019t meet his younger half-brother until 1985. President Obama, 54, has seven half-siblings from both sides of his family. Malik Obama seen announcing his intention to run for a Kenyan gubernatorial seat. Photo: Getty Images \"I don\u2019t think politics is my thing,\" he told The Post. \"Honestly, I\u2019ll be happy when my brother is out of office, and I will finally be out of the limelight and be able to live like a human being.\" When asked by The Post how many wives and children he has, Obama demurred. Obama made headlines in 2011 when he married his third wife, who was still in her teens. \u2018I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart. Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.\u2019 - Malik Obama Obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage \u2014 so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12. \"I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,\" Malik Obama told The Post from his home in the rural village of Kogelo. \"Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.\" Malik Obama, the eldest, is the director of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, a controversial Virginia charity named for his father. He says he started the charity in 2008 because he wanted to make a difference in the family\u2019s hardscrabble village in Kenya. But what bothers him even more is the Democratic Party\u2019s support of same-sex marriage. \"I feel like a Republican now because they don\u2019t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,\" he said. Malik Obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to Khadafy and others who were \"making this world a better place.\" Until then, Obama wears his new GOP colors proudly; He even has a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. He\u2019s also annoyed that Clinton and President Obama killed Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy , whom he called one of his best friends. \"She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,\" said Obama. Malik Obama lost the race, and spent $20,000 of his own money on the unsuccessful campaign. \"I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn\u2019t make things any better in Libya,\" he said. \"My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard.\" \"Mr. Trump is providing something new and something fresh,\" he said. \"That\u2019s personal,\" he said. Shortly after The Post report, the IRS gave its stamp of approval, leading to speculation that the president had intervened. But Malik Obama bristles at the suggestion, saying he dug deep to pay for the electrical transformers and college scholarships that the foundation provided in Kogelo. According to its latest tax filing, the nonprofit has just $24,000 in its coffers. But the charity came under fire when The Post revealed in 2011 that it was an off-the-books operation that hadn\u2019t registered with the state of Virginia or, as it claimed, had tax-exempt status from the IRS.

{"pred": "Research Reveals Indian Men Are Becoming Infertile. Here\u2019s Why! Infertility is no longer seen only in women. With the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days. A renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, Dr. Sonia Malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in New Delhi, stated that 46% of Indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. This is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. Another city gynaecologist named, Dr. Yashica Gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men. Studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. Statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per Society for the Study of Male Reproduction. But dear men, worry not! There is a solution to every problem. And while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it\u2019s not the only one. IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy. Nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting IVF centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child. However, the treatments aren\u2019t very budget-friendly. The minimum a couple spends on this is Rs. 1 lakh, which could be a matter of concern to a lot of individuals. Some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs. Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. The food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. Moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, Dr. Ved Prakash. It\u2019s okay to believe in the concept of YOLO, but what\u2019s the point if it\u2019s not going to give you all the happiness you need to live happily?"}

{"pred": "A Democratic presidential candidate has not won a majority of votes in Nebraska for more than 50 years. But on Thursday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state. The advertising buy is focused on Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district, and includes two ads about Clinton\u2019s advocacy for children. Clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you\u2019d expect: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevda, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina. In those states, as well as in her Nebraska ad buy, Clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in the 1990s. It is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there\u2019s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district. These are the two ads that will be playing in Nebraska. The second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska. It\u2019s an electoral strategy that Donald Trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. This week he campaigned in Maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a Democrat. He held a rally in Bangor in the state\u2019s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural. The electoral college\u2019s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon\u2014or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama\u2014are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. They predictably vote Democratic or Republican. But in Nebraska and Maine\u2014the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district\u2014there is more room for the parties to maneuver. They can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright. The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district\u2019s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average\u2014and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters."}
{"pred": "Believe it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications. As I\u2019ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president \u2014 even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump \u2014 to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it\u2019s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback. To get all the details on Trump\u2019s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer\u2019s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of \"fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.\" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump\u2019s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we\u2019re currently putting in place to deal with it. Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are \"phony.\" He added that he would \"rescind\" the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.\u2019s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord. Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016 This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both. It\u2019s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it \u2014 and the Clean Power Plan \u2014 are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What\u2019s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible. Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face: The near-term political consequences of this will \u2014 or should \u2014 be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don\u2019t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it\u2019s likely Sanders will see it this way, too. It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has \"nothing to lose\" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong \u2014 I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement\u2019s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders\u2019 own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump\u2019s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.

{"pred": "Five Extraordinary Trips To Make This Holiday Season Here are five extraordinary trips for them to make this holiday season. 1. Adventurous Christmas: Chile 5. Break the bank Christmas: The Maldives Experiences available to Asian tourists include running tours of Helsinki, a two-day package to see the Northern Lights and a one-day trip incorporating two capital cities, Tallinn and Helsinki. 4. Christmas-at-sea: Genting Dream The best time to visit the Maldives is from the second half of December to April, making it another destination pick that's perfect for the holiday season. Chileans are friendly and hosts at heart. The best time to visit is November to early March, so it's perfect for the holiday season. 2. Premium Christmas: Switzerland 3. Christmas in Santa's home: Finland For a holiday as rich as Christmas pudding, Switzerland is hard to beat. Think spellbinding street lights and snowy villages, where the only problem you face is too much choice of where to go. Though it's small, Switzerland is multifaceted with a variety of history and traditions. One clear travel trend this year is that more Asians are becoming free independent travelers (FIT), eschewing the ordinariness of coach travel for the novelty  and bragging rights  of new places and experiences. If you've been rewarded with a bonus as fat as Santa himself, treat yourself to a stay at Cheval Blanc Randheli. Owned by LVMH, it's one of the most stylish resorts in the Maldives with its contemporary minimalist design (by architect Jean Michel-Gathy), spaciousness (not just the size of the room; the resort's spa occupies another whole adjacent island), and extensive facilities to suit any tastes or needs (you have your own majordome for the entire stay who caters to your likes/dislikes and ensures your day runs just as you wish). As with all firsts, it's out to impress so you can expect keen service and a sparkling new vessel with such a wide range of facilities and entertainment it could be considered a destination on its own. This includes a waterslide park, Zouk nightclub (famous for its Singapore and Kuala Lumpur locations), more than 35 restaurant and bar concepts, the first Penfolds flagship wine vault at sea and a Dreamscapes enrichment program that will offer talks and presentations from esteemed speakers. Joining the cruise on December 10, for instance, is American astronaut Dr. Leroy Chiao, who will deliver a three-part lecture. Finland will mark its 100th year of independence next year and to mark the occasion, Visit Finland has launched a StopOver Finland initiative comprising 50 easily reachable packages/services lasting five hours to five days. It's also worth mentioning that Finland is the shortest connection between Europe and Asia, giving you even more reason to make the comparatively short trip. Everyone knowns Santa lives in Finnish Lapland and it's time you pay him a visit for all those times he came to your house. At least that's according to Visit Finland, Finland's official tourism promoter which, together with Finnair, has been recently courting Asian visitors  to visit the country. For cities, Zurich has the largest indoor Christmas market in Europe (until Christmas Eve) in the main hall of the Central Station where you can gorge on local treats from 160 stalls while your eyes feast on a Christmas tree decorated with 10,000 Swarovski crystals. Other highlights include a unique singing tree in town (come closer to the tree and you'll see it is actually filled with children singing Christmas songs) and the release of 800 floating candles into the River Limmat on December 22. Lapland, the largest and northernmost region of Finland, has 190,000 reindeers, 749 mountains and one Santa Claus. While there is a Santa's Village there, this amusement park may be too commercialized for some. Best to check out hotels and resorts that offer a more authentic experience where the highlights can include visits to husky and reindeer farms, hunts for the Northern Lights with a guide, snow mobile safaris and winter fishing. Party all night at Zouk on board Genting Dream. Photo credit: Dream Cruises. Then head to Zermatt for an alpine experience. It's car-free, leaving the snow-covered streets gorgeously illuminated for the holidays. And the Matterhorn never fails to mesmerize. There also aren't any large crowds at this time, making this a sublime place to have a Silent Night, Holy Night moment filled with love and gratitude. Another highlight of a Chile trip, especially for avid hikers, is a 19km hike to the base of Torres del Paine (Towers of Paine) to view the three 2,000-meter granite towers in all their splendor, a sight guaranteed to floor anyone. If you're after something different, why not eschew your boarding pass for a spot on a cruise? Hop onto Genting Dream, the first cruise ship of Asia's first luxury cruise line, Dream Cruises. It sails out from Hong Kong or Guangzhou in the south of China, and takes you to scenic destinations in Vietnam including Ha Long Bay and Danang. Northern Lights, Finland. Photo credit: Visit Finland. Use the capital Santiago as a hub and fly to hot spots like the Atacama Desert in the north, Patagonia in the south, or the mysterious Easter Island, famous for its nearly 900 monumental human figures with oversized heads carved right out of a volcanic mountain, then transported to different parts of the island  a gargantuan feat for mere humans. The sights are stupendous and varied: sand dunes, salt lakes, towering peaks, glaciers, geysers, lakes. Chile has it all in vivid colors.

While the allure of the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo remains blockbuster console and PC games, virtual reality and mobile gaming will have a bigger presence at this year's game industry gathering. It'll kick off Sunday with briefings from Electronic Arts and Bethesda Softworks and continue through Thursday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. There are several titles at E3 starring unlikely protagonists, such as scrappy survivor Joule of \"ReCore\" and introspective android Kara of \"Detroit: Become Human.\" A few sequels are adding new heroes to the fray.

Researchers from Ohio State University found that the best foods to banish garlic breath are raw apple and raw lettuce, the Huffington Post reports. Although it didn\u2019t get rid of the volatiles, mint leaves were best at masking the smell. But if that doesn\u2019t work, maybe you should try one of these scientifically proven odour eaters. Volunteers were asked to chew garlic cloves for 25 seconds before trying water; raw, juiced or heated apple; raw or heated lettuce; raw or juiced mint leaves; or green tea, immediately after. To be honest, this has just made me really want to scoff a load of garlic bread (I\u2019ll get some lettuce as well!). All the best foods are doused in garlic, but what about the lonely times that come after the clove cramming? When accused of housing that garlicky stench, I tend to take offence and charge them with being ungrateful for me protecting them from vampires. Plus, an apple a day keeps the odours away. They believe this is why raw foods were the most effective because they contain both the enzymes and the phenolic compounds. Heated lettuce sounds fucking grim. Wikipedia"}
{"pred": "VIDEO: He Went To Rip Weeds From His Lawn. Hours Later He\u2019s Dead. You Could Be Next. BE WARNED... It was only an hour after getting stung when John was gasping for air and told his wife three last words, \"I love you\" before he took his last breath and died. Doctors did everything they could to get his system back up and running, but to no avail. John got stung four times, and made his way inside to rest and get treatment. You never know when you might get stung by a bee, even if it\u2019s just doing the front garden like John was. Hi wife went and grabbed John an ice pack to help reduce the swelling, and John sat down to try and recover from the extremely painful stings that were attacking his body. Soon after getting stung though, John started acting strange. He started experiencing numbness, and had difficulty breathing. Something was evidently not right. One man from Tampa, Florida, was out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plants in his front lawn. John Clark missed the nest, and accidentally stepped on it, ushering a swarm of yellow jackets to come out and attack him. This was the case of a severe allergic reaction that John had experienced called anaphylaxis. This type of condition can be triggered from an allergic reaction from a wasp like John was stung by, but this type of condition is extremely dangerous due to its stealth. While getting stung by a bumblebee may hurt, it is not dangerous at all and is in fact worse for the bee itself rather than for the person that got stung. Yellow jackets and wasps pose a whole new threat though, because they are faster, stronger, and have much more powerful poison in their stingers than bees do. It is not uncommon to hear about somebody being stung by a bee or a wasp of some sort, as such type of insects and little bugs are very common in the outdoors. A simple way to prevent the severe and deadly reaction is with an EpiPen which injects a measured dose of epinephrine into your body to stop the reaction, but it must be taken in a very short time window after being stung. That is why if somebody is allergic to bee stings, getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful, and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly. Many people do not even know they can get anaphylaxis from a wasp or bee sting, and anybody can develop it at any point in their lifetime. It is important to get tested for this type of reaction if you are going to be spending time outdoors or doing yard work."}
{"pred": "When it comes to dining in Rome, there's a pasta dish to avoid\u2014unless you know the one place to try it. Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you\u2019ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won\u2019t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers. Which, in Rome, is rewarding in its own right. But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now\u2014loaded with cream, often with chicken\u2014is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't). There seems to be molto confusion around the origins of fettuccine Alfredo. Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes\u2014not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu."}

I knew I had to do something different this time. I had to find a way to make it work longterm. I knew \u200bgiving up too much and feeling deprived wasn't going to work this time. I experimented with programs such as Weight Watchers and Medifast, the cabbage soup diet and Atkins. Within six months to a year of starting my diet, my weight would creep back up to my heaviest. Before Weight: 350 pounds I make my own snacks, like roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, cashews and roasted chickpeas. I lost 20 pounds in 30 days and started going to the gym. I was sore for \u200bthree months straight, but I kept going every day. Even after losing 20 pounds, I could only walk on the treadmill at the lowest speed, but I kept going. I would be on it for an hour, take a break and get right back on. I stuck with the treadmill for the first nine months. After Weight: 169 pounds How I Gained It: Eating what I wanted and as much as I wanted and having no desire to exercise. I was missing out on\u200b family vacations and life's precious events. \u200bMy overall health wasn't good either: I was diagnosed with acid reflux, diabetes and high blood pressure. I knew I needed to make a change but did I? No. I looked at every diet plan I'd ever been on and came up with a lifestyle plan that would that fit my daily routine and give me long-term results. Because at the end of every diet, you've got to get back to real life. Now, I love going to the gym, and my energy level is off the charts. Everybody who knows me is cheering me on. I want to do everything: Spinning, dancing, running, horseback riding, traveling the world. Now, I can walk on the treadmill on its highest level for 45 to 50 minutes. For someone who could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being winded, I feel like I got my life back! For the first 30 days, I didn't eat any potatoes, pasta, white rice, flour, soda or sugar, and I drank no less than a gallon of water a day. I've learned to read labels. My meals consisted of baked chicken, fish and vegetables. As much as I try to stay away from processed foods, in some cases, it's hard to avoid, so moderation is the key. Shopping for clothes was pure hell for me. I ate myself up to a size 5XL and 30-32 blouses, 28-32 pants and 50 bra. I didn't have a lap; I couldn't hold my beautiful grandkids. Breaking Point: Three things: In July 2013, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Dallas and the seat belt barely fit around me. I was so embarrassed and wanted to cry.

We all gathered to take pictures. Later that evening as I sat on the couch looking at the picture, I noticed that my husband could barely put his arm around me. I looked at that woman in the picture and asked, \"Who are you?\" I didn't know the woman looking back at me. I was so sick and tired of all the blood pressure, diabetes and acid reflux medicine.

{"pred": "Here\u2019s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty My wife, Adrienne, and I are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving. From handing $5 to a homeless person on the street in Manhattan to raising $450 to give to a working father of one in rural South Africa \u2014 we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves. When we found GiveDirectly in November 2015, an org that gives $1,000, unconditionally, to people who are in extreme poverty, as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty, we fell in love. Unconditional \u2014 they can do anything they want with it \u2014 which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in \u2018the west\u2019 think it\u2019s risky...or even foolish. I think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age. Extreme poverty sits at the bottom of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid; leading to widespread health epidemics, overpopulation, lack of education, lack of environmental and conservational awareness, increased violence and pollution. We\u2019re all connected, and the more people who live in dignity, the better off we can all be. Do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea? Do you know of a better way? Now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village, and half from another, and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community. I think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells, offered solar panels, mosquito nets, donate clothes, built schools or built houses \u2014 only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community. Shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need. This is exactly why we believe in giving cash, and why we believe in GiveDirectly. Of course these people still have needs for more, but I can confidently say that 91% of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most, and 97% of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives, and I don\u2019t think other NGOs can say the same. One of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from GiveDirectly in 2014. She used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. She applied to work for GiveDirectly (GD often has 200\u2013600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. From living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from GiveDirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her. We\u2019ve told countless friends and family about GiveDirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as \"eh, I only give people food,\" and others such as; Margaret Osuma Oshien from Siaya, Kenya \u2014 A person who received just under $1,000 cash unconditionally from GiveDirectly.org Now, for the meat of it \u2014 we went into small Kenyan villages and met these people who\u2019ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). Here\u2019s the breakdown of how their money was spent: Beyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. Candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. We even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at GiveDirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. They were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives. \"I bet most people waste or squander the cash.\" iv. Leads to missed work and income 3.) Food \u2014 probably the saddest of expenditures, in my opinion, but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month\u2019s worth of corn to feed their families. I see it as the saddest because such a basic need, that\u2019s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits 5.) I\u2019ll hide this little gem in here: Many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person\u2019s propensity to seek these substances, however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers. \"General angst about the \"Savior Barbie\" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do \u2014 often a self-serving endeavor.\" 2.) School Fees \u2014 After primary school, Kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2\u20134 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards. Richard Aura Ongari from Homa Bay, Kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from GiveDirectly. The majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. Before being able to afford the medication, Richard could not walk, but now that he\u2019s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren. This small mud shack is home to 5. Before receiving his $1,000 transfer from GiveDirectly, Samwel Odhimbo Orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of Lake Victoria in Homa Bay, Kenya. This house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family. 4.) Other \u2014 Outside of those top three, which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on, people purchased medicines for chronic illness (Cancer, HIV, etc), livestock for income, and clothing & shoes. 5.) The \u2018mission\u2019 per se of how GD gives isn\u2019t about funding what they believe will have the most \u2018profitable\u2019 result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. Basically it\u2019s the ultimate \"anti\" ruthless capitalism. I loved hearing that. (i.e. not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y/o single mother of 4) Cavin Oginga (from Kenya) \u2014 A Field Ops Manager for GiveDirectly \u2014 who applied for a job there after running a research project on GiveDirectly\u2019s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having. 2.) There was really no \"savior barbie\" complex in the GiveDirectly operation \u2014 no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what\u2019s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission \u2018save the world.\u2019 Bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from GiveDirectly that sit in the recipients doorway / living room / foyer / children's\u2019 bedroom / guest\u2019s bedroom This finding is consistent with a publication from World Bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world. \"How do they make sure people aren\u2019t defrauding them or stealing the cash?\" 4.) Let\u2019s face it \u2014 \u2018data\u2019 is boring and unsexy, yet it\u2019s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. GiveDirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. Every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. And we\u2019re not talking about just any old data. We\u2019re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) \u2014 the holy grail of \"I\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong.\" Not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (I\u2019m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they\u2019re doing something, it\u2019s because their data, and 3 other independent sources\u2019 data has proven that\u2019s the right decision. 3 children of GiveDirectly Recipient Eunice Awino Omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in Siaya Kenya (Where President Obama\u2019s Grandmother lives!). Eunice\u2019s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof, and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains. b. No home \u2014 living with 4\u20138 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut In August 2016, my wife and I visited GiveDirectly\u2019s office in Kisumu, Kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the Siaya (where President Obama\u2019s grandmother lives!) and Homa Bay regions. After meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we\u2019ve heard in the past: Outside of GiveDirectly\u2019s Country Headquarters in Kisumu, Kenya 3.) Auditing \u2014 The rigor behind this operation is crazy. They have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process \u2014 from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there\u2019s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited. With GD\u2019s rigorous measurement and auditing, they find the effect on vice spending (tobacco, alcohol, etc.), is \"negative and insignificant,\" meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption...Here is the 3rd party study conducted by Princeton.edu ) The vast majority of the team are local Kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. We think that\u2019s fantastic, since we\u2019ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to GD goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in East Africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. There\u2019s a huge unemployment issue in Kenya and other East African countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community. \"It probably doesn\u2019t have long-term impact, such as building a school could.\" c. Upgrading home \u2014 living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls) 1.) Housing \u2014 everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and FYI we didn\u2019t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (That size home would house 5\u20139 people)) iii.

Dirt floor in home \u2014 constant insect infestation, including \"jigas\" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain.

Since we currently travel abroad full-time, and Kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of GD\u2019s operation. ...and more. ii.

Only difference is, we'd lost the war before we even started fighting.\" Another officer told him: \"We've thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. In the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up.\" Woods' book will open the public's eyes to the raw violence and canniness of the drug world, and the lengths police will go to in order to disrupt it. But after years fighting at the apex of the drug war, his conclusion\u2014and that of other experienced officers who have chosen to speak out\u2014must be heeded if we want to find a solution to a problem that has been trashing communities around the world for decades. \"The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery,\" says Woods. Now, after having left the force, he is chairman of LEAP UK (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials. But to what extent are Woods and his colleagues at LEAP UK\u2014and those currently employed in the police force\u2014rare specimens? How thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? Expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition\u2014even to their colleagues\u2014is something of a risk in the black and white, \"them and us\" world of police culture. Surprisingly, he tells me around half of Britain's elite drug detectives at NCA have similar \"liberal\" attitudes to the drugs problem. Despite all this, there was acceptance\u2014often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints\u2014that they were not waging a \"war on drugs,\" but managing an unbeatable problem in order to \"keep the public happy.\" But what about those drug cops working below NCA level, in towns and cities across the UK? To gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall\u2014so that's the exact position that University of Sheffield criminologist Dr. Matthew Bacon took. He spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the UK and wrote about his experiences in Taking Care of Business , published last month. Drug cops, who saw themselves as \"elite crime fighters,\" had sufficient respect however for the the Mr. Bigs of the drug world. They saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a \"good collar\" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues. Good Cop, Bad War is the story of an undercover police officer, Neil Woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating Britain's biggest drug gangs. The book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters. Ultimately, his experiences led Woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the UK. Most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. Drugs were seen as being behind all that's bad in society. This gave them a \"righteousness\" in their actions, observed Bacon. But within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with. Even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs. There are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. When I went stop and searching in Soho with one of the Met Police's sniffer dog teams in 2013, I was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. \"I say legalize the lot,\" one said. \"Legalize it and tax it,\" said the other. \"If someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it's up to them. I can't see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. The official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not.\" It's perhaps not surprising, given the police's moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed \"junkies\" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. In 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: \"It made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. I was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis.\" \"I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day,\" he says. \"I get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who's] replaced within two hours. But the reason it's worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it's weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault\u2014which all go hand in hand with the drug trade. One female drug cop I spoke to told me: \"There are some pretty nasty pieces of work out there, but some of them are just ordinary people. Behind every user and runner, there's a story,\" she said. \"A lot of people say drug addicts and drug dealers are scum of the earth, but they don't know anything about them.\" To the anti-drug teams Bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as \"police property\"\u2014objects that police could do with as they wished. \"Almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws,\" says Bacon. \"They were made the scapegoat of the drug problem.\" I call up Simon Kempton, a police sergeant from Dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the National Board of the Police Federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. He agrees with Woods\u2014that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country\u2014but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out. Fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it's the same with the larger fish. \"Whenever we remove a big guy, someone else\u2014usually a lieutenant\u2014replaces him within days. The more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder.\" \ue605 A Met Police officer with some confiscated drugs.

There are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug users and even dealers. \"Law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the Misuse of Drugs Act came into force in 1971,\" says Fisher. \"The idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn't work. We've spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there's less chance of it working than Canute stopping the waves. However, Sgt Kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by Durham Police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : \"With dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. While policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, I believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime.\" On the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target. \"If the NCA stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing,\" he explained. \"You would see little change in the high street. Society would not collapse. As it is, drugs are freely available now. All that would happen is that dealing would be more open. But it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide.\" \"Undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. Undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it's very cost effective. It's rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that's been gathered. Yes, people can feel demoralized that they've put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that's the way it is sometimes.\" Fisher's solution is to take the Portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. \"I believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. It will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes,\" he says. \"Ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments.\" I spoke to Mike Fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for Britain's organized crime busting bureau, the National Crime Agency (NCA). He asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the NCA's annual report. \"We are taking out the worst people in our society. When they assault people it's not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. These people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. You have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you.

{"pred": "This seagull fell into a vat of chicken tikka masala. I think I can e... Chicken tikka masala is undoubtedly delicious. But this is not the reason a seagull loitering at a food factory in Gloucestershire, England, fell into a vat of it this past Monday. Gulls are what's known as \"opportunistic kleptoparasites,\" meaning they don't derive 100 percent of their diets from heist but rather just steal when the opportunity arises. And a big vat of tikka masala is an opportunity no gull can afford to miss. And it's not just human food. Gulls and some other birds will steal food right from the clutches of other birds, mid-flight. For it to be considered kleptoparasitism, the biologist Erika Iyengar explains , the parasite has to steal food from the host, and the host has to suffer as consequence. (The people who were not able to eat that delicious spiced chicken because, gross, a bird was in it, definitely suffered.) Seagulls are what biologists called kleptoparasites , animals that rob the food of other species. And the birds can be damn cunning about it. Seabirds breaks down the percentage of which species of seabirds get their food from robbing. There are some, like the Arctic skua (a.k.a. the parasitic jaeger), that feast primarily on the food of others. Perhaps you've seen photos of the bird, colored orange from his dip. (Turmeric, a key ingredient in curry, contains a potent orange pigment.) It looks like he\u2019s trying to cosplay as an Angry Bird. According to Seabirds: Feeding Ecology and Role in Marine Ecosystems, kleptoparasitism is a survival strategy that minimizes the energy expenditure needed to obtain food. Basically, the gulls have realized, why search for your own food when there's some perfectly good food in another animal's possession? They need to be clever to do so. Birds that are kleptoparasites tend to have bigger brains than birds that live the straight and narrow. But why?"}
{"pred": "The One Thing Morgan Freeman Still Thinks Is Terrible About The Shawshank Redemption By Dirk Libbey Throughout his career, Morgan Freeman has been in a ton of incredible movies like Shawshank. In fact, his mere presence is enough to get most people excited about a movie, but did you know he was actually in one of the biggest flops of 2015? In fact, the movie made so little that almost no one even knows the film exists. Click over to the next page for the full story. As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn\u2019t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King\u2019s novelladoesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth\u2019s name, which is something, although it\u2019s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn\u2019t help. In the long run, however, fans find great movies and they eventually did find, making it one of the most popular films ever made. Continued On Next Page > Blended From Around The Web Comments Facebook Appearing on Shawshank Redemption was a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.

{"pred": "Right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for. Despite what happened, Michael Usry\u2019s father does not regret participating in a DNA study, but rest assured that his son never will. A new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our DNA The day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie\u2019s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp\u2019s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?   After getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you\u2019re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road. Then I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a \"familial DNA\" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State\u2019s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase \"familial DNA\" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous \"Grim Sleeper,\" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest. A little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer\u2019s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating. I first learned about the 20-year-old murder of Angie Dodge in a roundabout way, after getting my DNA analyzed by one of those commercial DNA databases. When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation. After I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge\u2019s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp\u2019s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to \"48 Hours\" executive producer Susan Zirinsky. CBS News correspondent Anne Marie Green writes about how she came across this story, and the Angie Dodge murder investigation, which she reported for \"48 Hours\" in \"The DNA of a Killer.\" As I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie\u2019s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent.

{"pred": "Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie - Little White L... While today\u2019s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film\u2019s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it\u2019s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively \u2013 and one that\u2019s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal. And yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC\u2019s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once. In today\u2019s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it\u2019s tempting to read 2000\u2019s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters\u2019 origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It\u2019s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint. The present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable\u2019s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis\u2019 David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie. It\u2019s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson\u2019s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin\u2019 snakes on that muthafuckin\u2019 plane, Hollywood\u2019s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults). Two years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi\u2019s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel\u2019s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. Between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. \"These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn,\" Jackson tells Robin Wright\u2019s Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable. \"People are starting to lose hope.\" He didn\u2019t know the half of it. It may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there\u2019s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan\u2019s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi\u2019s Spiderman films). I n the Superman comics there is a character called Bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero. Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There\u2019s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character. If Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson\u2019s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative \"Mr Glass\" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk\u2019s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.

{"pred": "Something Crazy Is Happening to Swiss Bonds, and It\u2019s a Sad Sign for the World Economy The most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you! Why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort\u2014you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country. These days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt\u2014or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value\u2014is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it\u2019s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two. All of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation. Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition. You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it. Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate\u2019s senior business and economics correspondent.

{"pred": "Walt Disney may no longer be with us, but he's left behind a legacy of films that have ultimately been with most of us since the time we were born. For as long as I can remember, Disney films have been a major part of my life. Growing up, I constantly watched the classics with my family. Now, I find myself venturing off into some of Disney's newer films. But regardless of the year they are released, almost every Disney film has one thing in common \u2013 the main character almost never has a mother. But why? Now some skeptics might point out that there are also a lot of characters who don't have any parents at all \u2013 like in Aladdin. Hahn explained that the lack of mothers in his films might have been a result of something that happened to Walt and his family. Something tragic that involved his mother... Cinderella? No mom. The Little Mermaid? No mom. Pocahontas? No mom.  And let's face it \u2013 most Disney movies are about growing up.  But even in those films, there are side characters who have a father and no mother. Recall Jasmine's dad the Sultan? No wifey. But that's not the only possible reason for the lack of motherhood in his movies. Don explained that the lack of parents in the films is just an easy way to allow the main characters to grow up. \"One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and Disney films are about growing up\" says Hahn. \"Bambi's mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It's a story shorthand.\" Hahn went on to explain that this isn't a method Disney created himself, but one that he borrowed from many of the fairy tales his movies were based on.  Because longtime Disney producer Don Hahn recently offered two very insightful theories behind Walt's method. And one theory behind it is quite sad! Well if you've been trying to think of a reason behind this common plot structure, look no further. Think about it!"}

Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn\u2019t be identified \u2013 at least at first. Mark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. \"When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,\" he told the West Australian. \"Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.\" After drifting away from the carcass, Watkins spotted it beginning to deflate. It looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the Indian Ocean. The sea is dark and full of terror. Well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of California the other week. A non-deceased humpback whale. Gudkov Andrey/Shutterstock \"Seeing it was great,\" Watkins noted on Facebook. \"The smell, not so much.\" Clearly, the entire experience was quite over-whale-ming (sorry). Although the exact species of the whale hasn\u2019t been declared, it\u2019s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western Australian coastline. The stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. On occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury."}

The fact that the Playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an N64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op Perfect Dark.

Of course, this could be the first step in a PC-ified home-gaming experience. One in which gamers will intermittently upgrade their systems and won\u2019t have to shell out $500 every 5-7 years, thus rendering their previous console obsolete.

The old Costco AmEx card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually.

For instance, the Chase Freedom Visa card is offering an outstanding 5% cash back on purchases at warehouse clubs such as Costco, BJ\u2019s, and Sam\u2019s Club. The cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it\u2019s been extended to the entire year So, looking ahead, Chase Freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of Costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), and again during the fourth quarter (October 1 to December 31).

But, as he explains in the YouTube video above, online gaming eventually gave him a sense of purpose. \"I am ready to talk to the world about me, my injury and how I live positive every day,\" he wrote on Reddit. According to an interview with CTV News, one of his viewers recently wrote him a letter, saying, \"I was about to shoot myself.\" The man who had considered disconnecting is now saving others' lives. Worrall never expected to catch people's attention -- or hearts -- in the way he has. When asked during his Reddit AMA how many people he expected to watch him, he wrote, \"Maybe thirty?... When I was in the thousands I was in a loss for words and I had tears running down my face because I've never had that sort of reaction from that many people loving me and wanting the best for me.

Worldwide, developed nations would have to pay more than $1.1 trillion annually to developing nations on top of massive emission reductions to keep climate change in check. \"We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us, and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people,\" Lidy Nacpil, director at Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement on Debt and Development, said in a statement. \"It\u2019s not just a question of being fair. It\u2019s about being realistic. To be realistic means if we want a hope of stopping climate change, these transfers have to happen. These deep cuts have to happen. That\u2019s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.\" For the United States, the bill comes to $634 billion owed to developing nations. The U.S. also would need to cut carbon emissions 55 percent to 65 percent, according to the Stockholm Environment Institute, Friends of the Earth, and Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement for Debt and Development. Kartha added that the online calculator shows not just what the whole world has to do to mitigate climate change but also helps answer the fundamental question in U.N. climate talks of what each country should do. The environmental groups created an online tool showing how much each country should cut emissions and how much money should be given to developing countries not fully responsible for global warming but that would be devastated by climate change nonetheless. That even includes nations such as China, now the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter. \"Based on those limits on climate pollution for the whole world, it is striking just how quickly emissions need to come down, across the world.

That means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid. The tool\u2019s calculations are based on the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, which puts precise figures on emission cuts and money amounts needed to hold an increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2025. But how do we know all those billions transferred among nations would be put to good use and not squandered? \"The organizing of democratic, accessible, and people-first financing systems is a core part of many organizations\u2019 demands,\" Rafalowicz wrote in an email. \"That\u2019s why they are focused on making sure the U.N. Green Climate Fund is not established in a way that makes it easy for big multinational corporations to capture the finance there, for example.\" How did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? The first scientific attempt to calculate each country\u2019s \"fair share\" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population. Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, said that IPCC\u2019s numbers show that temperature increases greater than 2 degrees could have irreversible effects on the world\u2019s climate. Alex Rafalowicz, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said the creation of a transparent U.N. Green Climate Fund is paramount to the plan."}

Yet amid the bad, the ugly and the end of Brangelina, there was still some good you might have missed while you were standing in your room crying to Joni Mitchell. For most people, any bad day can be made slightly brighter by the mere thought that \"Hamilton: An American Musical\" is out there and might, one day, be enjoyed by you again or for the very first time. In June, the hip-hip Broadway sensation took home 11 Tony Awards \u2014 including Best Musical, the biggest prize of all. But the most moving moment of the ceremony came when show creator Lin-Manuel Miranda delivered his emotional \"Love is love is love\" speech while accepting the award for Best Score. Hours earlier, a lone gunman had killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando. President Obama made history in March when he became the first U.S. leader to visit Cuba in 88 years, culminating 15 months' worth of effort to reestablish diplomatic relations between the two countries. In addition to Obama's trip, Cuba and the U.S. have both taken steps since 2014 to end decades of hostility by opening embassies, restoring commercial flights and negotiating agreements on a range of issues \u2014 including the environment, law enforcement and communications. There is looming uncertainty, however, as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will maintain warmer relations with the communist country once he takes office. The unemployment rate in November fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest in nine years, the Labor Department said earlier this month. To compare: When President Obama took office in 2009, the unemployment rate was at 7.8 percent.

On his way out, Sianis is reputed to have declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,\" thus spawning the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat that lasted seven decades.

{"pred": "So what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? Even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation. Ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes. Who can guess what evolution has in store for us ten thousand years hence? How will humans look 10,000-100,000 years from now? originally appeared on Quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. Thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist. All life on earth is constantly evolving; the process doesn't stop. As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes. Another example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans. Our mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet. Darwin's theory of natural selection evolves. Answer by Matan Shelomi, Organismic and Evolutionary Biologist, on Quora: Another famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too. This question originally appeared on Quora.

Complying with its order, the board filed a report and favoured medical termination of the pregnancy. It said that the foetus was detected with anencephaly, a serious defect where parts of the skull are not adequately developed. The court said, \"The foetus is not compatible with living outside the uterus. In other words, the foetus would not be able to survive. Equally, rather more important, the continuance of the pregnancy would endanger the physical and mental health of the petitioner\". Coming to rescue to a 24-week pregnant woman facing danger to her life due to an abnormality in the foetus, the Supreme Court on Monday granted her permission to terminate her pregnancy. This is the third incident in recent years when the apex court has allowed women to abort beyond the period prescribed by law. In July last year, the court had allowed a rape survivor's distress plea to abort her 24-week pregnancy citing serious abnormalities with the foetus. On the basis board's suggestion, the bench allowed the lady to undergo an abortion and directed that the termination would be done under the supervision of the board. The court said that it was not necessary to go into \"medical and medico-legal aspect of the identity of the foetus and the matter is to be decided from the standpoint of the petitioner to preserve her life\". The bench allowed a plea of a Mumbai-based 22-year-old woman to terminate her pregnancy after taking into account her medical report which of a team of seven doctors of King Edward Memorial(KEM) hospital in Mumbai.  The apex court had appointed the board of seven senior doctors to conduct a medical examination of the lady and directed it to file a report about her \"condition and advisability of permitting a medical termination of pregnancy\". \"In these circumstances, we consider it appropriate and in the interest of justice, particularly the right of the petitioner to preserve her life, that she be allowed to undergo the termination of pregnancy. The termination shall be done by the doctors of KEM hospital. Further, the termination shall be supervised by the same medical board,\" the bench said. The woman approached the court after doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy as it was not allowed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.

{"pred": "For the first time, Republican Donald Trump seems to have edged ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in presidential polling. But only just. What does it mean and should those opposed to Trump be worried? That gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at RCP) to conclude \"it\u2019s probably time to panic\". I\u2019d disagree. For those concerned about the prospect of a Trump victory, it\u2019s been time to panic for a while \u2013 zooming out from a single statistic shows it. Although this might be the first time that Trump has come out on top in the RCP polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions \u2013 in September and December of last year. Since September, Clinton\u2019s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6. In other words, there have been many other periods when Trump\u2019s opponents should have been worrying before now. The polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race. That\u2019s problematic in itself; this election can\u2019t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate\u2019s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the White House. Each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate\u2019s support is distributed throughout the country. The polling data site RealClearPolitics (RCP) takes an average of national polls that ask Americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable). On Sunday, RCP updated their numbers to show that Trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of Clinton. Part of the reason why they didn\u2019t panic before was a belief that measuring American public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns. Why? Because people change their minds. November is still six months away. The alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift. Looking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are \"safe\" \u2013 based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them. Unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might \"swing\" and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally \u2013 states like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. So far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a Trump win. Just as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that Trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the Republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the White House. Polling is far from perfect. To understand what will happen when the country votes this November, pundits would do better to look at the electoral map, demographics and \u2013 most importantly of all \u2013 listen to the concerns of voters. FOX News: Trump leads by 3 percentage points CBS News/New York Times: Clinton leads by 6 percentage points NBC News/Wall Street Journal: Clinton leads by 3 percentage points ABC News/Washington Post: Trump leads by 2 percentage points Methodologies matter. They\u2019re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy. Take the ABC News/Washington Post poll for example \u2013 those numbers have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. That means that Trump\u2019s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 5.5 percentage points. Or it could be that Hillary Clinton actually led by 1.5 percentage points. Rasmussen Reports: Trump leads by 5 percentage points There\u2019s another, much bigger problem with the RCP average, though: it\u2019s only as good as the individual polls that make it up. RCP always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted. Once you peek under the hood, you\u2019ll see that an average of 0.2 percentage points flattens out some very different findings. These are the five latest polls RCP used to calculate Trump\u2019s narrow lead: These polls have different results in part because they use different methodologies for assessing public opinion. Although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by NBC/WSJ and Fox News only spoke to registered voters, Rasmussen interviewed \"likely voters\", while the ABC News/Washington Post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters). Polling on a pedestal Democratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the Democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote. In 2008, Barack Obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote. Clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional Democratic strength in populous states such as New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. Delayed panic? All that said, the RCP polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be. All polls claim to speak to a \"nationally representative\" sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based. Perhaps Rasmussen Reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in Iowa \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. Languages matter too. Two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in Spanish and English \u2013 it seems that the others did not."}
{"pred": "Wax inside a whale\u2019s ear stores all sorts of useful information on the animal\u2019s exposure to pollutants and stress levels throughout life, researchers have found. Whale Ear Wax Reveals Animal's Exposure To Stress & Toxins, Scientists Say Whale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber. But it also records time \u2014 similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period. In baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death. The team, led by Sascha Usenko, a environmental scientist at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, extracted an earplug from a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) killed in a collision with a ship off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, in 2007 and found it had come into contact with several organic pollutants and contained high levels of the stress hormone cortisol as it reached sexual maturity. The whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study. Maternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans. Once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate. \"Some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years,\" says Usenko. Other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way. Mercury \u2014 which can cause brain damage \u2014 spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years. Decimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000\u201312,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution. Scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean. But analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted. The male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study. (Michelle Berman-Kowalewskic, Ph.D., Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Santa Barbara, Calif.) \"It\u2019s difficult to recover time-specific information on chemical exposure for almost any animal,\" says Stephen Trumble, a biologist also at Baylor and a co-author of the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. That is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world\u2019s largest inhabitant. This story originally appeared in Nature News. Over the whale\u2019s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled. The peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition. But it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise. Usenko and his team are now hoping to investigate that question by analysing some of the 1,000 or more whale specimens in museums worldwide. \"If we can look at individuals that lived in an environment without some of the stresses we see now, then we could tease out the causes of the cortisol increase,\" he says. The research is \"exciting\", says Jeremy Goldbogen, a marine biologist at Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington, but \"the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study.\" Usenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years. During his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants. Exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year \u2014 and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact \u2014 suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing.

{"pred": "Daniel Radcliffe On 'Kill Your Darlings' & Moving Beyond, But Not Forgetting, Harry Potter There's little doubt that if Daniel Radcliffe were a rock musician, his current press tour for \"Kill Your Darlings\" would have a title like \"The Moving On Tour '13\" or \"Harry In The Rearview Mirror.\" Yes, Daniel Radcliffe is no longer Harry Potter -- as a recent New York Times Magazine profile deftly illustrated -- but what's interesting about Radcliffe (great, even) is that he's not anti-Harry Potter. What was your reaction when you heard J.K. Rowling was revisiting the \"Harry Potter\" universe with \"Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them\"? Were you surprised? Here's your for instance: In \"Kill Your Darlings,\" Radcliffe plays a young Allen Ginsberg, who, at the outset of the Beat generation, finds his friend, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from. \"The Woman in Black\" felt like its narrative was basically, \"Here's Daniel Radcliffe's first post-Potter role,\" and now, with these, people have moved on. I had never heard her say \"no.\" I don't think any of us would ever be foolish enough to, you know, say never. But, I think with Jo, I wasn't really surprised. It kind of made sense to me actually, when it was announced. Because I was kind of like, \"OK, yeah, she's gone off and had 'Casual Vacancy' and then done the Robert Galbraith books -- and both have been very successful. And I imagine that has given her a confidence of, \"Oh, OK, now that I stepped away from it, I can actually go back to it with confidence.\" And I think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the \"Potter\" world. And, yeah, she's wants to give people what they want. And I think it will be really good. I'm just relieved that it's in her hands, to be honest. That lets me know that it's not anyone just cashing in and it's going to be authentic. [Laughs] Yes. Yeah, I know what you mean. But, you know, I think that's what I liked about Potter and that's what I'm still very proud of about Potter. Even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. I think the reason I'm so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. That's not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. So, yeah, I still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise. Because, when I was growing up, I don't remember people talking about franchises before I was in one. I remember people talking about \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Potter\" would be like \"franchises\" that's the first time I remember ... Not only do you have \"Kill Your Darlings\" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, \"Horns\" and \"The F Word.\" It's not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it's happening. I think that's a really astute observation. I think that's completely true. \"The Woman in Black\" was a fantastic transition because it wasn't so different than Harry that people were like, \"Oh, he's just trying to shock us.\" But it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. And the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. I may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there's still stuff I see when I see that that's very reminiscent of Harry. I only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last \"Potter.\" So, it came very soon after. But I do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything I've done before. I just think I've grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years. And I think, as a consequence, my work's gotten better and I'm just looking forward to people finally seeing it because I feel like I've been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves. I think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, \"Potter\" was the biggest thing that I'm ever going to do and I'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. But if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it's an amazing start to have had and it's something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. And I just have such fun doing my job, as well. Like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like \"The F Word\" and \"Kill Your Darlings.\" I know! I know I do. I have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one. Because \"Star Wars\" is filming in Leavesden. There was at least one guy, Digby Milner, who worked on all the \"Potters\" who had also worked on \"Star Wars,\" the originals. And he will be working on new \"Star Wars\" at Leavesdon as well. And it is kind of amazing because \"Star Wars,\" the originals, were made in England as well. So there's a lot of that crew who we'll basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new \"Star Wars\" movie. And I think there's definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don't really have peers when you're 12 or 13 that you look to in other films. When you're 16 or 17, you start becoming aware of guys like Aaron Johnson or Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw or James McAvoy. And you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, \"Oh, I want to do what they're doing. I want to have loads of different parts as well.\" So it builds up this desire to get out there. \"Kill Your Darlings\" is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that's really not that well known. Absolutely. Lucien, for reasons you understand when you see the film, did not want anyone to know this story. But I definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it: people didn't know. And one of the things I think people will like about this film that I think, perhaps, they won't expect is that when you hear \"1940s Beat poet historical drama,\" you sort of think, Oh, that sounds quite dry. But it's actually a lot of fun as well. I don't think you can make a movie about the Beats without having fun -- because they had a great fucking time. Like when we're introduced to Jack Kerouac, it felt dramatic. I mean, I didn't know the story at all. I really wasn't aware of it. That's one of the things that's so cool about it -- and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go, \"Wow.\" When you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known -- and, yet, this story has really never been told -- you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we've struck.

A Choice Not an Echo by Phyllis Schlafly 5. Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman 3. The Closing of the American Mind by Allan Bloom The late great matriarch of modern conservatism, Phyllis Schlafly, did more to advance and win the battle of ideas than many young conservatives understand. The tip of her intellectual spear, A Choice Not an Echo, reshaped the contours of American conservatism and has sold an astounding three million copies since its release over a half-century ago. The original anti-establishment crusader, Schlafly\u2019s book argued that conservatives must be willing to fight for a voice within the Republican Party\u2019s establishment leadership and helped pave a path for Barry Goldwater\u2019s nomination. 2. The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek 7. Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 6. A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell Hailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, Gulag Archipelago is the first-person account of Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the Russian gulags for criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Communist system in his private letters. A winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, Solzhenitsyn\u2019s ability to combine lyrical prose with piercing reportage of communism\u2019s moral horrors are virtually without equal. 1. Ideas Have Consequences by Richard Weaver There are no \"bad\" Thomas Sowell books, so we could have easily recommended many of his other classics. But A Conflict of Visions crystalizes the stakes involved in the clash between conservative and progressive ideologies\u2014and how radically different outcomes are when one side prevails over the other. One of America\u2019s most lucid conservative economists, Sowell\u2019s book draws upon everything from Rousseau to Hobbes to Adam Smith to illustrate the intellectual impulses that drive conservatives and progressives to think and act the way they do. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman redefined the field of economics. In addition to being an intellectual titan, he was a sterling writer with a knack for distilling complex topics with wit and clarity. Any Nobel Prize winner who can string together a sentence like this deserves to be read: \"If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there\u2019d be a shortage of sand.\" Long before anti-MILO rioters sparked violence at UC Berkeley, a University of Chicago professor named Allan Bloom lit academia ablaze with this 1987 classic taking the professoriate to task for eroding higher education curriculum with progressive pablum. A staunch defender of the classical \"canon\" of great works every thinking person must read, Bloom explained how the intellectual corruption of the humanities and arts led to an erasure of students\u2019 understanding of the proper moral order that undergirds Western Civilization. Originally published in 1948, Ideas Have Consequences foresaw the corrosive influences of moral and cultural relativism decades before the Left harnessed those forces to undermine Western civilization. One of America\u2019s greatest conservative intellectuals and an esteemed twentieth-century rhetorical scholar, Richard Weaver erected an intellectual fortress around Absolute Truth long before progressives mounted their frontal assault on notions of right versus wrong, good versus evil. In the age of Bernie Sanders, today\u2019s young generation of would-be socialists would do well to read Friedrich Hayek\u2019s 1944 classic broadside against socialism, The Road to Serfdom. A member of the Austrian School of economics and a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Hayek warned of the totalitarian realities of socialism\u2019s conceits. As he put it elsewhere: \"A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.\" As the populist-conservative movement continues to grow and expand in the Age of President Trump, a new generation of energized voters and young people will do well to arm themselves with the intellectual firepower of the giants upon whose shoulders today\u2019s movement rests."}

{"pred": "Katherine Heigl's Difficult Behavior Is 'Not Worth It,' According To Hollywood Insiders Katherine Heigl's behavior on set has become notoriously difficult, and a scathing article by Kim Masters for The Hollywood Reporter rounded up a number of industry insiders who are getting fed up with the star once known fondly as Dr. Izzie Stevens. A producer at a major network, who reportedly turned down Heigl for a project, explained Heigl's difficult behavior, simply saying, \"She's not worth it.\" Heigl's behavior has sparked some sour reactions in the past. Most notably, the actress publicly knocked her two biggest successes, calling \"Knocked Up\" sexist and announcing she would not seek an Emmy for her role in \"Grey's Anatomy,\" because the writing wasn't up to her standards. Heigl's latest films, \"The Big Wedding\" and \"One For The Money,\" have collectively pulled less than 10 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and returning to the small screen after her big screen failures is certainly a questionable move. So, has Heigl's career reached its end? As Masters put it, \"Hollywood has infinite patience with difficult talents -- until the box office stops booming.\" Except it wasn't just Heigl causing problems on set ... her mother was often part of the problem. The \"Life As We Know It\" source added: \"I have never experienced anything like Nancy Heigl. It's about the mouth. 'F--- you. You are a f---ing liar.' ... Whatever you'd say, you were an idiot. The call would be, 'This is the worst craft service we've ever had! There's nothing to eat! This is the worst wardrobe!' You knew that every day, you were going to get slammed.\" According to Hollywood insiders, the issue extends to her conduct on set. One source from the 2010 film \"Life As We Know It\" recalled \"desperately difficult situations\" with the actress, saying, \"she can cost you time every single day of shooting ... wardrobe issues, not getting out of the trailer, questioning the script every single day.\" Check out The Hollywood Reporter for the full story."}
{"pred": "Specific Foods That Can Affect Sleep Eat These Foods for Better Sleep Both diet and sleep are complex, which means there\u2019s no silver bullet or single food that is guaranteed to help with sleep. However, there are some foods and drinks that may make it easier to get a great night\u2019s sleep. Researchers, including nutritionists and sleep experts, have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep. While this research provides important clues, it\u2019s not conclusive. In general, there\u2019s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep. Nuts like almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and cashews are often considered to be a good food for sleep. Though the exact amounts can vary, nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are essential to a range of bodily processes. In a clinical trial using supplements, it was found that a combination of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc helped older adults with insomnia get better sleep. That said, there are indications that certain foods can make you sleepy or promote better sleep. Sometimes this is based on a particular research study and in other cases on the underlying nutritional components of the food or drink. A research study found that fatty fish may be a good food for better sleep. The study over a period of months found that people who ate salmon three times per week had better overall sleep as well as improved daytime functioning. The impact of carbohydrates on sleep may be influenced by what is consumed with them. For example, a combination of a moderate amount protein that has tryptophan, a sleep-promoting amino acid, and carbohydrates may make it easier for the tryptophan to reach the brain. Turkey is an example of a protein with high levels of tryptophan. Studies of carbohydrate intake and sleep have had mixed results overall, but some evidence connects rice consumption with improved sleep. Dietary choices affect more than just energy and sleepiness; they can play a major role in things like weight, cardiovascular health, and blood sugar levels just to name a few. For that reason, it\u2019s best to consult with a doctor or dietician before making significant changes to your daily diet. Doing so helps ensure that your food choices support not just your sleep but all of your other health priorities as well. With as many as 35% of American adults suffering from symptoms of insomnia, it\u2019s understandable that there\u2019s a strong desire to take advantage of food and drinks for better sleep. Researchers believe that fatty fish may help sleep by providing a healthy dose of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, which are involved in the body\u2019s regulation of serotonin. This study focused particularly on fish consumption during winter months when vitamin D levels tend to be lower. Some research has found that eating kiwi can improve sleep. In a study, people who ate two kiwis one hour before bedtime found that they fell asleep faster, slept more, and had better sleep quality. A study of adults in Japan found that those who regularly ate rice reported better sleep than those who ate more bread or noodles. This study only identified an association and cannot demonstrate causality, but it supports prior research that showed that eating foods with a high glycemic index around four hours before bedtime helped with falling asleep. At the same time, sugary beverages and sweets have been tied to worse sleep, so it appears that not all carbohydrates and high glycemic index foods are created equal. Additional research is necessary to fully identify the sleep-related effects of different carbohydrates. These benefits may come from the fact that tart cherries have been found to have above-average concentrations of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm and promote healthy sleep. Tart cherries may also have an antioxidant effect that is conducive to sleep. It is not known for sure why kiwis may help with sleep, but researchers believe that it could relate to their antioxidant properties, ability to address folate deficiencies, and/or high concentration of serotonin. Several studies have found sleep benefits for people who drink tart cherry juice. In one study, people who drank two one-cup servings of tart cherry juice per day were found to have more total sleep time and higher sleep efficiency. Milk itself contains melatonin, and some milk products are melatonin-enriched. When cows are milked at night, their milk has more melatonin, and this milk may be useful in providing a natural source of the sleep-producing hormone. In the past, small studies found that malted milk before bed reduced sleep interruptions. The explanation for these benefits is uncertain but may have to do with the B and D vitamins in malted milk. Malted Milk and Nighttime Milk In addition, the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent. For example, some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none. Climate and growing conditions may further alter the nutrients in any particular food product. Whether it\u2019s a jolt after a cup of coffee or drowsiness after Thanksgiving dinner, most people have personally experienced how food and drinks can affect their energy and alertness. Rice Tart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice Kiwifruit possess numerous vitamins and minerals, most notably vitamins C and E as well as potassium and folate. Fatty Fish As the name indicates, tart cherries have a distinct flavor from sweet cherries. Sometimes called sour cherries, these include cultivars like Richmond, Montmorency, and English morello. They may be sold whole or as a tart cherry juice. Nuts Kiwi The kiwi or kiwifruit is a small, oval-shaped fruit popularly associated with New Zealand even though it is grown in numerous countries. There are both green and gold varieties, but green kiwis are produced in greater numbers. Malted milk is made by combining milk and a specially formulated powder that contains primarily wheat flour, malted wheat, and malted barley along with sugar and an assortment of vitamins. It is popularly known as Horlick\u2019s, the name of a popular brand of malted milk powder."}

The beauty blunders that are making you appear ten years OLDER (and how to fix them fast) According to the top beauty gurus in the business, applying your foundation, blusher and concealer incorrectly can add decades to your looks. 'You should actually brush blusher sparingly from your ear to halfway across your cheekbone, which will make your face look slimmer,' he said.  Always do your brows: Brows tend to thin as we age, but having a structured brow can take years off of your face, instantly lifting and defining your eye area. Karla advises avoiding gels and pencils - which can leave brows looking too harsh and \u2018drawn on\u2019 - and opt for a powder formula, which will give a much more natural finish.

Avoid dark eyes  Avoid dark eyes: Celebrity facialist and makeup artist, Nathalie Eleni, says that dark kohl under the eye can look harsh if not blended so opt for a softer shadow and blend along for a softer finish.

Don't skip the moisturiser Always do your brows with powder Stay away from pressed powders: Rupert King maintains that they create a heavier, dryer look to the skin. 'Instead, aim for a more dewy, moist look to the skin, it will help to soften those dryers areas where the fine lines can show up. If you still feel too shiny choose a micro fine loose powder and just apply to the centre of the face.'    Stop using a heavy coverage foundation: Rupert Kingston, co-founder of Delilah Cosmetics, explains that high coverage foundations can really accentuate fine lines and wrinkles. 'It's better to use a lighter, fresher foundation to make the skin look more natural,' he advises. 'Just use concealer where you need it.' Apply under-eye cream correctly: Eva Alexandrides, managing director and co-founder of 111Skin, explains that the skin underneath the eye is a different structure to the rest of the face and thus is a lot more sensitive. 'Rubbing and pulling at the skin as you apply the cream is a real no go and will make the bags appear worse and more visible. Don't skip the moisturiser: Karla Powell, MUA and brand ambassador for MUA Cosmetics, says that applying make-up to un-moisturised dry skin can enhance your lines.

Stay away from pressed powders  Stop using a heavy coverage foundation 'Use your ring or little finger when applying cream whilst only dabbing, tapping or softly massaging the area with sweeping strokes. Finally, give it about a minute or longer to absorb before you put any make up on top of it which will prevent any \"caking\" around the area.'"}

A recent study conducted by Insure.com surveyed 2,000 drivers from across the country to determine once and for all which state has the rudest drivers of them all. And the results will surprise you. (MORE: 10 Cities With the Worst Drivers) It's logical to think that states with notoriously bad traffic would produce some of the nation's rudest commuters, and while states like New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia fall in the top 10, the state with the absolute rudest drivers is tucked away in the Rocky Mountains: Idaho. The survey concluded that Idaho is made up of two main types of drivers -- \"those who are moving so slowly that they're judged to be rude, and the aggressive drivers who speed around them and flip them off.\" The imperfect marriage of these two driving types propels the Gem State to the top of the list. One responder took a stab at explaining the strange dichotomy happening in the Northwest. Eric Leins of Southern California posited that Idaho's rural and mountainous terrain was to blame. He argued that residents and seasoned drivers are familiar with the twists and turns and lack the patience for those who are navigating the state's roads for the first time. Another survey responder said that he thinks everyone in that state is just content to take their time on the roads and don't seem to have the same sense of urgency drivers in other states have. The study's runner-up rudest state is the nation's capitol: Washington, D.C. A respondent who had relocated to the District of Columbia from Los Angeles compared the attitude of driving to the town's politics: \"self-serving, abrasive and unsafe.\" Another indicated that he wished he had a nickel for every driver who couldn't be bothered to signal when switching lanes.

{"pred": "For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They\u2019ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read! What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character\u2019s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you\u2019ve tried on. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into the world of reading. Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term \"literary fiction\" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that\u2019s what it means in the context of their study). Your brain does amazing things while you\u2019re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people. Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn\u2019t be able to experience on our own! So after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents. Take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own. And in choosing your next book, make it a tough one. Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you\u2019re not only becoming a smarter person, you\u2019re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise. \"We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...\" Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read \u2013we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books\u2013 but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits? This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment \"conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).\" The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com: Which book inspires you the most? The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as \"mudbloods\") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry. In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby. \"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\" In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is.

{"pred": "Does Your IQ Correlate With The Rap Music You Listen To? by @PaulDickerson18 So if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD\u2019s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter if someone\u2019s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar\u2014it doesn\u2019t in any way reflect someone\u2019s intelligence. So the other day, I was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. The tweet, which I\u2019ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn\u2019t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I\u2019ve seen tweets before that have told me that I\u2019m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I\u2019m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions. Now, I can\u2019t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren\u2019t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I\u2019m not considering the force that is Death Grips\u2019 Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I\u2019m not) is Lil Yachty\u2019s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I\u2019ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What\u2019s wrong with putting Kodak Black\u2019s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist? Hip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don\u2019t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn\u2019t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes. A person\u2019s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person\u2019s brain power. So stop hating, throw on some Lil Yachty, and don\u2019t be afraid to like it. There will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I\u2019m guilty of it as much as I\u2019m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It\u2019s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There\u2019s a reason Common isn\u2019t ever requested at the bar. I don\u2019t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song? In fact, there\u2019s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn\u2019t make a difference what I thought.

It\u2019s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren\u2019t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers. First of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM.

Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has)."}

With her flat stomach, toned arms and excellent health, you'd never guess that this female bodybuilder is in her late 70s. But she is -- 77, to be exact. Shepherd did, and was declared the World's Oldest Performing Female Bodybuilder by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010. (Edith Wilma Conner now holds the title.) Ernestine Shepherd, 77-Year-Old Bodybuilder, Says 'Age Is Nothing But A Number' (VIDEO) For her students, Shepherd encourages exercise in any shape or form. \"Not everybody wants to be a bodybuilder. Not everybody wants to be a runner,\" she explains. \"But find what you like to do. I say to my senior ladies -- and the men -- 'Don't forget: Age is nothing but a number and you can get fit.'\" As impressive as her physique is, one of the most incredible parts of Shepherd's story is that she didn't even start working out until she was 56. Shepherd and her sister, Mildred Blackwell, decided to get fit after they tried on swimsuits and weren't happy with what they saw in the mirror. The sisters set their sights on becoming two of the oldest female bodybuilders. However, after Mildred died, the devastated Shepherd ended up with high blood pressure, panic attacks, acid reflux and depression. Then, Shepherd says her sister appeared to her in a dream, urging her to follow through with the bodybuilding dream they had conceived together. Since then, Shepherd says her health had dramatically improved. \"I do the same thing day in and day out,\" she says on an episode of \"Oprah Prime\" that also featured Sharon Stone. \"No high blood pressure medicine. No medicine for panic attacks. No medicine for acid reflux. By me out running and walking, the depression and anxiety just left me.\" Part of Shepherd's everyday routine includes waking up at 2:30 a.m. and reading devotions from her Bible. In addition to running and working out, she eats 10 egg whites (scrambled) along with a handful of walnuts and drinks 16 ounces of water. She also teaches classes at her Maryland gym, Energy Fitness. \"I started my class with 10 people in the class. That class has grown -- some mornings everybody can't get in the room,\" Shepherd says."}

Have you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You\u2019re not sleeping enough, even though you\u2019re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full. For years this has been the focus for learning new things. But as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. Even more important is our ability to break down the old ones. It\u2019s called \"synaptic pruning.\" Here\u2019s how it works. \"Glial cells\" are the gardeners of your brain\u2013they act to speed up signals between certain neurons. But other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves. Your brain\u2019s pruning gardeners are called \"microglial cells.\" They prune your synaptic connections. The question is, how do they know which ones to prune? Researchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, C1q (as well as others). When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy\u2013or prune\u2013the synapse. There\u2019s an old saying in neuroscience: neurons that fire together wire together. This means the more you run a neuro-circuit in your brain, the stronger that circuit becomes. This is why, to quote another old saw, practice makes perfect. The more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling , the stronger those circuits get. Imagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons. These are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across. When you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they\u2019re inefficient, ad hoc connections. Your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways. It does that when we sleep. The ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections."}
{"pred": "What Would Happen if the Olympics Banned Russia? For the average American Olympics viewer, the absence of Russian athletes might go unnoticed. Where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is Russia. \"You cannot separate the Olympics from politics,\" says Wallechinsky. \"That\u2019s a myth. Russia is already saying this a Western plot.\" Countries have been banned from the Olympics before, but it\u2019s always been for overtly political reasons. Germany and Japan were not on the Olympic guest list for the 1948 Summer Olympics, South Africa was banned during the apartheid era, and Afghanistan was banned in 2000. If the IOC does ban Russia, that\u2019s enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack. And many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to Russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the US, as they did at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that the Soviet Union boycotted: In the absence of the USSR, the US\u2019s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the Soviets returned to the Olympics in 1988. \"For the Olympic movement, it\u2019s a huge deal,\" says David Wallechinsky, the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"This isn\u2019t Tonga or Paraguay, it\u2019s one of three big medal winners.\" The potential Russian ban wouldn\u2019t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because Olympic athletes\u2019 doping is inherently political. \"If doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an Internet connection and a PO box, it can take on an element of politics,\" says John Gleaves, co-director of the International Network of Humanistic Doping Research. And state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so. This morning, the Court of Arbitration for Sport made a ruling on Russia\u2019s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: It upheld the International Association of Athletic Federations\u2019 ban on Russian track and field athletes in the Rio Olympics, whether there\u2019s hard evidence they were juicing or not. The International Olympics Committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it\u2019s also still possible it will ban the country altogether\u2014a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in Rio, but the state of international athletics. Imagine the most stereotypically Russian way an Olympic doping scandal could play out. Are you thinking sketchy FSB agents? Passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? And everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to Putin? Because then you\u2019d be absolutely right. One of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the Olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. \"The anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement,\" says Gleaves. \"How much anti-doping work can Kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in GDP?\" The Russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports. If the Russians competed in Rio cleanly (or, as Noland says, \"no dirtier than average\"), his models suggest they\u2019re good for 66 or 67 medals. So how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? If they managed to nab 11 extra medals in London, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. Noland figures the Russians would have come away with about 80 medals. Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, GDP, and other variables. In London, the Russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted\u2014meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. And his numbers have been borne out: The Olympic committee has since reallocated 11 Russian medals from the London games. And this scandal seems an appropriate place for the IOC to draw that line. Look at what happened to East German athletes in the 1970s. \"At the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women\u2019s competitions,\" says Noland. \"There was no informed consent. You now have high rates of birth defects amongst East German athletes. The stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. I regard this as really evil.\" Whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games. Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport\u2014and failed on all those accounts,\" says The Games: A Global History of the Olympics .

{"pred": "Don't tell her she's getting bigger and NEVER touch the bump: Fertility expert reveals the pregnancy etiquette EVERYONE should follow If someone tells you they're pregnant, they have chosen to tell you and not your friends, family and random followers on social media.  So what should you be saying to your friend who is expecting? Midwife & fertility guru Zita West, who has helped thousands of women get pregnant and looked after celebrities including Kate Winslet and Sophie Wessex during their pregnancies, shares her advice. Many of the most clueless comments that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pounds.  The decision on when to announce a pregnancy is not up to you, therefore, don't instantly go to congratulate them on social media because you might share friends that they haven't told yet, or they simply might be keeping the news under wraps until they feel ready. When someone tells you they are pregnant, it might feel natural to touch their bump or comment on how big they are getting.  If you really want to, you can politely ask if you can touch someone's pregnant belly, but don't be offended if they say no as this is one of the most annoying and uncomfortable moments for pregnant woman.  Every woman is different, some may have severe symptoms, some may find pregnancy a breeze, only they are aware of their limits and how much they can take.  Pregnancy can be a scary time for women. Their lives are about to change and many fear how they will think/feel/cope 'on the other side'.  But telling a pregnant woman about your two day labour that ended in emergency c-section and you losing half the blood in your body is not helpful.  Whenever anyone's having a baby, others love to share stories of their own experiences of labour.  The bottom line is that all women try their best and most women, even those who worry they might not be natural mothers adapt once their children arrive.  It is genuinely terrifying for a woman pregnant with her first child to hear labour horror stories, so don't share them. Pregnant woman can still have fun, go out, exercise and more, attend meetings, head departments and in today's day and age, where so many women are doing multiple things like running businesses, building extensions and becoming mothers, they last thing they want is to be treated differently.  That said, pregnancy can make women tired so do offer her a seat on the tube. 3. Don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant This often happens with women I see who are also in high flying jobs. When they say they are pregnant, their friends and colleagues jaws drop open and they get things like 'But you're such a career woman' or 'I didn't think you were maternal'.  Hearing opinions from everyone else is stressful for mothers to be. It's easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born.  Although pregnancy is in a way a medical condition, pregnancy is not an illness.  A pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so there's no need to be constantly reminding her that she's huge, big, or massive. Even if she's looking a large she doesn't need to hear it. Labour is a process and the great news is that in today's world, with all our wonderful medical advances and pain control, most women get through it, and usually, once the baby arrives, memories of labour fade away.  Problems arise when she tells you what she's going to name her child, and you can't resist sharing all your opinions on why this is a good or bad decision.  And whether or not you think she fits into the classic mould of a 'maternal woman' doesn't mean she won't be a brilliant mother. But although these comments are not intentionally rude, insensitive, or inappropriate, they can easily come across the wrong way to a woman who is on a hormonal roller coaster. People can be ambitious and be mums. It's not one or the other. Whether or not you've seen her maternal side doesn't mean she doesn't have one!  But I've met thousands of mothers over the years and you know, they've nearly all been absolutely fine, grown into their new role admirably, coped well and become wonderful parents. This is what she needs to hear.  It might take some longer than others to take to motherhood, but that is understandable as there's a lot to take on as a mother in terms of looking after a baby, and juggling whatever it is they will have to juggle, whether that's other children, elderly relatives, high flying careers, evening courses, husbands and everything else.  If her baby is kicking and she wants you to have a feel, she'll invite you to. You may think you're paying a mama-to-be a compliment when you say, 'You're so tiny' or 'I can barely see your belly!' but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby. 2. Don't ask if she has chosen a name 8. Don't tell her labour horror stories Invading people's personal space is not normal etiquette for everyday life. You wouldn't rub or touch someone's belly on a normal day, so why is this any different?  1. Don't touch her bump Following on from the previous comment, it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them, 'are you gaining enough weight?'  4. Don't tell her she's getting bigger (and bigger) 9. Do tell her she's going to be just fine While seeing a friend's bump grow can be really exciting, don't comment on the size or shape.  6. Don't congratulate her on social media 5. Don't tell her she's not big enough I've found that all children seem to perfectly fit their names in time, even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first. If you throw in fear of post-partum depression and then the very real experience of having post-partum depression, it's no wonder women feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead.  7. Don't act like she's sick This might not seem like a big deal, but it can be to those who haven't thought of a name yet or those that have, but feel that they might be bombarded with judgmental opinions.  Gone are the days when we would name our child John or Jane, in recent times there's been a general trend to more creative names, such as Wolf or Apple. "}

JK Rowling: Single Motherhood Is The Thing I'm Most Proud Of In an essay for Gingerbread, an organization that supports single parents in the UK, Rowling -- who is the president of the organization -- says that being a single mom to daughter Jessica gives her the most pride. Rowling went on to say that she is working with Gingerbread to enact policy changes that will positively impact the lives of single parents and their children. Despite her fame and success, Rowling writes that the single parent stigma persisted. This isn't the first time Rowling, who is now remarried, has opened up about single parenthood. In 2011, Rowling appeared on the show \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" to learn more about her ancestry and discovered that several of her ancestors were single moms as well. \"I would say to any single parent currently feeling the weight of stereotype or stigmatization that I am prouder of my years as a single mother than of any other part of my life,\" she wrote. \"Yes, I got off benefits and wrote the first four Harry Potter books as a single mother, but nothing makes me prouder than what Jessica told me recently about the first five years of her life: \u2018I never knew we were poor.

{"pred": "Keeping Legal Drinking Age At 21 Saves 900 Lives Yearly: Study Laws that maintain the legal drinking age at 21 save lives on the road, and protect young people from other hazards of drinking, according to a new review of studies. Researchers examined the evidence from studies conducted since 2006, and found that laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drink are linked to lower rates of drunk-driving deaths among young people. However, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents. Researchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced. Instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said. On the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption. In one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said they'd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states. \"The evidence is clear that there would be consequences if we lowered the legal drinking age,\" said study researcher William DeJong of Boston University School of Public Health. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health] In fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision. They also argue that the current laws haven't led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption. Looking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea. U.S. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. The benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated. During that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25. Teen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the Federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21. \"Recent research ...has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths,\" the researchers wrote in their study published today (Feb. 24) in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. Researchers also found that current drinking restrictions have not resulted in more binge drinking among teens, as some have suggested. \"Some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them,\" DeJong said. \"But it really is the case that enforcement works.\" \"Clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law \u2014 and advertise that fact to students \u2014 student drinking declines,\" DeJong said."}

How would their fortunes, and the inventory value of CS:GO\u2019s other 10 million active players, be affected by this announcement? The announcement was a surprise. Although scrutiny of CS:GO gambling peaked as it was revealed that two of the world\u2019s most popular gaming YouTubers had created a CS:GO skin gambling website and quietly promoted it to their audiences, some of these services have existed for three years . Other than a match fixing scandal in 2015 this was the first time that Valve has addressed them. The drop in price seems reactionary, a reflection of some sellers\u2019 fear that the market would implode. Although the correction was very uniform across the items I sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price. More adjustments can probably be expected as gambling websites close or alter how they operate, but my belief is that these items will retain most of their value as long as CS:GO remains one of the most-played and most-spectated games in the world. Valve\u2019s announcement went out via email just before 1 PM Pacific on June 13. I sampled a set of 20 arbitrary, higher-volume skins on the market, and found that they fell an average of 13.7% that evening. A Minimum Wear AWP BOOM skin, for example, dropped from $21.75 to $18.56 12 hours after the announcement. On Wednesday Valve announced it would begin sending requests to cease operations to gambling websites that use Steam\u2019s trading system. \"Using the OpenID API and making the same web calls as Steam users to run a gambling business is not allowed by our API nor our user agreements,\" wrote Valve\u2019s Erik Johnson. Not much. Although there isn\u2019t an index number that reflects the value of the CS:GO item market as a whole, sales data for individual weapons tend to show an initial reaction to the news, followed by normalization.

{"pred": "This Decadent Pumpkin Pie Recipe Has a Salty Secret This is that pie after it left home and learned some things. This is that pie come back with secrets and scars and stories to tell. It tastes familiar, like sugar pumpkins smoothed out with dairy and set with eggs, but it\u2019s more complex and delicious than ever. The recipe (see below) comes from Lisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie in Detroit. She doesn\u2019t fear this year\u2019s looming canned pumpkin shortage because she makes the filling from a bunch of different winter squash, split and roasted in her bakery\u2019s kitchen. Between September and November, the mix changes depending on what\u2019s good, from delicata and butternut to buttercup and hubbard. I\u2019ve enjoyed plenty of pies made from canned pumpkin pure\u0301e and evaporated milk. They are perfectly smooth and mild and custard-like, and they make everyone happy. This pie is not that pie. At least, not anymore. Ludwinski\u2019s mother has already ordered pies for the family\u2019s holiday meal from Sister Pie, and her grandmother will supplement the dessert spread with her own pumpkin pie. That one will be made according to the directions on the side of the can, using ready-made pie dough, and it will also be gone before the end of the day. Lisa Ludwinski of Detroit\u2019s Sister Pie amps up canned pumpkin with a variety of winter squash and a layer of tahini. Cardamom-Tahini Squash Pie 1\u20442 cup canned pumpkin pure\u0301e Behold Sister Pie's delicious tahini-cardamom squash pie in all its glory. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg Step by step: blind-baking crusts, filling them with tahini-walnut paste, pouring over the roasted squash filling, and getting the pies into the oven. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg For the pie filling 7. Fill and finish the pie: Brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini\u00ad-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). Pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. Bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. The pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it\u2019s cooled if you like to serve it cold. For the pie dough 1. Prepare the pie dough: I\u200bn a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it\u2019s in coarse pieces about the size of peas. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes). 5. Prepare the pie crust: Flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that\u2019s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 \u00adinches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes. This Thanksgiving will mark the shop\u2019s first holiday since its opening back in April in Detroit's West Village, and Ludwinski is planning to stay open until noon to sell locals fresh pies like sweet potato-marshmallow, brandy-pecan, and salted maple pumpkin. \"It just seems kind of silly for a pie shop to be closed on Thanksgiving,\" she says. Ludwinski moved to New York in 2006 to pursue a career in theater, but she was sidetracked by the food scene. At Momofuku's Milk Bar, where she worked for Christina Tosi, she developed a taste for low-moisture, high-fat Plugra butter, which Ludwinski now uses for all her doughs. \"You\u2019ve got to use it every time,\" she says, \"because the flavor is so different, and so clear.\" She picked up the habit of adding a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dough at Four & Twenty Blackbirds pie shop in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ludwinski spent a year making pies. Ludwinski says this gives the crust a bit of extra flake and a mild tang. 2. Roast the squash: While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. Place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. Bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin pure\u0301e and mix until smooth. (If the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) Set aside. 6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P\u200breheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees. Sister Pie's counter is filled with other goodies, such as these freshly baked peanut butter cookies (spiked with paprika). Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg A little cream infused with floral cardamom pods loosens up the mixture, which Ludwinski pours over an almost jammy spread of cream cheese that\u2019s been blitzed with toasted walnuts and tahini, the peanut-butter-like paste made from sesame seeds. That thin layer of soft, pleasingly salty tahini-walnut spread is what makes this pie sing. Lisa Ludwinski runs a team of 12 at Sister Pie, which in addition to pies also sells cookies, shortbread, and savory dishes like salads. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg Note that if you're not up for doing everything from scratch, you can follow a side-of-the-can pie recipe and just add that bottom layer of Ludwinski's lovely sesame-walnut paste for a delicious twist.

Ingredients: One of Michigan native Ludwinski\u2019s earliest memories is of her parents taking her to a Cinnabon and seeing the magic behind the scenes. \"I will always remember watching people put the cinnamon into the dough, the slicing and the icing,\" Ludwinski says. It\u2019s no coincidence that at Sister Pie she designed an open kitchen, too. Anyone walking in for a cup of coffee and some shortbread can see bakers scooping cookies, sealing hand pies with a fork, or rolling out dough by hand.

{"pred": "The Dillinger Escape Plan have returned to Reading Festival for the first time after vocalist Greg Puciato took a dump onstage and hurled his excrement into the crowd during the band's 2002 performance at the event, all because of Puddle of Mudd. Watch: Dillinger Return to Reading Fest After Singer's Onstage Dump, Wasn't Quite What People Expected As widely reported, the Dillinger boys are breaking up after the release and touring cycle of their upcoming album \"Dissociation,\" due out on October 7. \"Once you got over that fear I think we started to realize that this feels like a very empowering move to say hey, now you can look at the Dillinger Escape Plan as a body, an artistic body, not just on an album-to-album basis, but you can look at the whole band artistically and say this is what this was. And it had a beginning and it had an end and they did close the circle and it is this thing that you can look at as a whole. \"And that we had used our relationship with one another and our artistic outlet together in Dillinger Escape Plan to kind of work through a lot of things as people and as a couple of people. We started to reach this resolve - a thematic resolve - and it started to show itself in our music and our lyrics. Back to the Reading 2016 performance, you can check out the footage below. This time around, the singer emphasized his civilized side by singing the set's opening number \"Prancer\" sitting on a couch, reading newspaper and sipping tea. \"We don't love making records any less. We don't love being onstage any less. And that's the hard part - you're making a choice to stop doing something you love which sounds insane to people. \"And I think we both just started to realize like, 'Hey, if we're ever going to draw a line and say this is over, this seems like a good time.' And we started talking about it and the fear aspect of it in a way, cause right away there was this gut feeling of, 'Oh shit, my safety net is being taken away.' Puciato told Metal Hammer about the band's decision: \"'Extended hiatus' would leave people to believe that we think that we're coming back. We're breaking up, we're not going on an 'extended hiatus.' \"Or when you make a movie you don't just film until you run out of film or hard drive space, you make a decision artistically to say, 'Even if I'm having the best time ever, this is the end.' \"So in the last few years we started to reach what felt like a thematic conclusion to our band, you know particularly Ben and I where we realized that in our lives psychologically that we were reaching sort of a resolve. \"But really what it's about is realizing that if you're a painter you don't just paint until you run out of paint. You don't just paint until your arm falls off. You make a decision at some time that you made a final brushstroke. \"And I feel like once we started to wrap our brains around that we started to feel really comfortable about it. It feels correct, that's all I can say about it.\" \"This is a really weird thing to say but we really do still love what we do. We don't love it any less. \"You know I don't like TV shows where they just go on and on and on until the ratings die. I like a movie where someone says hey this has an end and I made it and at the end I don't want to do another one. I don't want to see 'Pirates of the Caribbean 7' you know?"}

The mischievous bear entered the Colorado Cherry Company by breaking through a window and climbing onto the oven, where he proceeded to eat two dozen pies as well as \"bags of cocoa and a bag of sugar,\" the owner's daughter Mikaela Lehnert told The Guardian . The morning after the pie raid, Lehnert and her mother arrived to find their store in shambles, with two boxes in the yard. And, with 24 pies devoured without a trace, they have reason to believe that the bear enjoyed his dining experience \u2013 and may return. While it sounds as if the bear was indiscriminate in his tastes, he actually had quite the discerning palate. \"He went for the apple and the cherry and left behind the strawberry rhubarb, so he was a picky little guy,\" Lehnert said. \"If anything it's boosted [our business] because it put our pies and product out there.\" Hunger makes us do crazy things.

With the new patent filed by Apple recently, no one would not think what the Cupertino-giant is preparing in the pipeline. The report stressed that this quirky innovation by Apple has already been in use around its stores across the globe and not too many noticed it until the patent came out. Apart from the patent being filed by Apple, the new paper bag innovation caught the attention of the tech community because of its support to environmental preservation. Apple has filed lately a patent application with code US 20160264304 A1 for a paper bag. According to a report by The Telegraph, the patent is described as \"a bag container formed of white solid bleached sulfate paper with at least 60% post-consumer content.\" Meanwhile, the company has slowly been introducing efforts to improve current state of the environment. Earlier this year, Apple made public a robot called Liam to partake in recycling old iPhone units. In 2015, the company said almost 100% of its energy usage came from renewable sources. Apple will open its first retail store in South Korea. The country is Samsung's home turf. Accordingly, this paper bag is made of 60% recycled materials. As Apple's application stated, \"The bag may be formed entirely of paper with the potential exception of adhesives for fixing together portions of the bag. This can help to reduce any environmental impact from production, use, and disposal of the bag.\" It furthered that the bag container material can be suitably used for many times even after slight tearing. However, like the wireless earbuds Apple produced for the iPhone 7, the paper bag technology has drawn flak and sarcasm from netizens. (Scurzuzu / Flickr)"}
{"pred": "Nicola Knight, an analyst at Horizons, which provides information on the food sector, said sprouts are now seen as a more versatile winter ingredient than just a traditional festive accompaniment.   Britain\u2019s top sprout expert has urged the nation\u2019s cooks to reconsider their approach to the Christmas staple whose fortunes are starting to be revived. It is the age-old method for cooking Brussels sprouts, handed down the generations and put into practice at least once a year. But it now seems that by cutting a small cross in the base of each sprout all this time, we have all simply been doing it wrongly. \"Brussels sprouts have moved away from the poor little malign Christmas sprout image, and it has seen demand increase,\" he said. Matthew Rawson, chairman of the Brassica Growers Association, said: \"Boiling them was traditionally the way of doing it, but putting the cross in puts in too much water. The sprout farmer has teamed up with Aaron Craze, a Youtube cooking star, to set up the website loveyourgreens.co.uk and to promote the wonders of his beloved brassicas. Mr Rawson, who farms in Yorkshire, added: \"People now are learning that it is a very versatile vegetable. The big ones lend themselves well to a stir-fry. People are steaming them, and there are fancy microwave packs. It is being driven forward by people who are more creative.\" And instead of boiling them, we should be steaming, stir-frying or even microwaving Brussels to get that perfectly crunchy consistency. \"They turn soggy and rubbish. People who do that have ruined the Brussels sprout.\" He credits the new vogue for dishes such as Brussels sprouts with pancetta and chestnuts or pistachio and pomegranate sprout salad with revitalising the vegetable\u2019s fortunes. She said: \"Following on from the recent rise in popularity of spinach and kale, Brussels appear to be the latest vegetable to benefit from growing awareness of the health benefits of leafy greens.  Brussels on pizza? Now that\u2019s surely a step too far. \"It\u2019s happened over the last decade. Certainly people do eat more of them \u2013 there are a lot more foody programmes on television and foody magazines, and it is there in their subconscious.\" \"The reality was that people who were eating our products were the older generation, and the older generation keep dying so we had to link in with younger generations and mothers,\" said Mr Rawson.  \"We are now seeing them used in soups and salads, and as a topping for burgers and pizza.\" \"It was just another way of experimenting with our product.\""}

Krant recommends choosing a thick, fragrance-free cream instead of a lotion, which can be watery, and putting it on after every shower. Dr. Bobby Buka , a dermatologist in practice in New York City, also encourages a thick moisturizer. \"I like non-petroleum based moisturizers,\" Buka told HuffPost Healthy Living. \"Naturalists should like this too! Ceramides are naturally occurring moisturizers found in many emollients nowadays.\" Rating: 4 out of 5. Dry skin be damned with this moisturizer.

I could immediately feel and see how it locked in much-needed moisture. The finish was quite smooth and my complexion did appear brighter over my two weeks of use. However, I did use tinted BB cream or liquid foundation to bring a bit of color back into my face. At first glance, the moisturizer looked thick and heavy in the glass jar. However, I was shocked at its lightweight texture. Because my skin skews on the sensitive side, the cream's paraben-and-oil-free formula blended with moisturizing ingredients like white tea extract and vitamin E also made it appealing.

{"pred": "Can Linux ever beat Windows at PC gaming? Windows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming. But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming? A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs. Evidently, Windows isn\u2019t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there\u2019s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve\u2019s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn\u2019t help that a number of companies still haven\u2019t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system\u2019s handicaps. There\u2019s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10. More at TechRadar New this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 820. IBM\u2019s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won\u2019t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell\u2019s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register Did you miss a roundup? Check the Eye On Open home page to get caught up with the latest news about open source and Linux. Linus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild. Game Carey reports for TechRadar: Simon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register: FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project\u2019s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD\u2019s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host\u2019s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux.

{"pred": "How to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones How to actually talk to a woman wearing headphones A recent and deeply-sinister guide for men on how to talk to women wearing headphones has outraged many. Here\u2019s a more honest and accurate guide 4. When she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, \"Take off your headphones for a minute\" and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands. \"These days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time. However, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her.\" Next Dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. Sadly not one of them is to sod right off. \"Headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world. you see, the very reason I and many other women wear headphones isn\u2019t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. It\u2019s a defence. A defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. In short, we wear them because we don\u2019t want to be talked to. It\u2019s basic physics really - we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in. If a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won\u2019t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones. You: [Smile in a friendly, confident manner] Hey \u2013 I know it\u2019s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but I was walking along and saw you and thought \u2013 wow, she\u2019s a cutie, I have to say hi. I\u2019m Dan, what\u2019s your name? If she doesn\u2019t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, \"I want to talk to you for a minute.\" You: [Add in some humor] Cool...nice to meet you Jessica. I don\u2019t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me. If a woman has her headphones in, the answer is never - and before you bleat on about \"ooh, what if there\u2019s a fire?\", she\u2019ll smell it, even through all your bulls**t. If you\u2019re in a bar or party, her flirtatious smile may be the come-on you\u2019re looking for, but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong, politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing, insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini. But how about this In most cases, you won\u2019t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening. That being said, if a guy wants to get a woman\u2019s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him. 5. Then, do what we call \"Acknowledging the Awkwardness\" by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn\u2019t the most common of experiences for either party. Anyway, coming soon from Dan Bacon, \u2018How To Talk To A Woman Through A Fog Of Pepper Spray\u2019. Probably. Woman: [Most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction]. Controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. In other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine.\" Her: Please leave me alone. 3. Is she hasn\u2019t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can\u2019t ignore it. 1. Stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you). \"No matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn\u2019t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to. This helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to. You: [Let her know that you have something to do/somewhere to go, so she understands that you\u2019re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] Anyway, so I\u2019m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. I\u2019m on my way to a store up the street. How\u2019s your day going so far? Woman: [Usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] Jessica. An article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is The Internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. Written as dating advice for \"The Modern Man\" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot \u2018n\u2019 horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn\u2019t a parody. What to Do to Get Her Attention Women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy\u2019s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner? Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t talk to them. Here\u2019s Dan\u2019s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point Jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security: 3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction By step 4 I\u2019ve learnt that you can\u2019t understand a basic body language brush-off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. My brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it\u2019s trying to figure out just how aggressively you\u2019re going to react to any further action I take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time. If a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.\" So when, I hear the whiny pissbabies ask, when am I allowed to approach hot single women? Simple. This is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her. Of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking. The author, one Dan Bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his \"How to\" with \"Don\u2019t\". Sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here Him: I see you don\u2019t want to be talked to but I find you physically attractive and I\u2019m making that your problem. The advice here is basically \"No doesn\u2019t mean no, it means keep going until you get what you want - the screaming will stop eventually\". Because apparently that\u2019s what women want - and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases. Trust me, when we tell you to go away we aren\u2019t testing your measure as a man, we\u2019re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction. 2. Allowing her to ignore him 2. Have a relaxed, easy-going smile. I appreciate the world of mating is hard but please, for the love of humanity, learn this: just because you want, doesn\u2019t mean you can have. Women are not commodities to be hunted and won, and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with, that\u2019s your problem, not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules. It\u2019s a playbook we never signed up for and it\u2019s only a game if both teams actually know they\u2019re playing. Here\u2019s how it plays out in real life. Trust me, I\u2019ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors: I don\u2019t know if these five steps are a common \"thing\", but I have personally experienced this several times. At step 1 I know what you are doing and I\u2019m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere Hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. By step 3 I\u2019m not feeling \"excited\" and I\u2019m not feeling \"flattered\" as Dan later tells his readers I will be - I\u2019m feeling harassed. Straight up, dictionary definition harassed. take up a hobby, ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or (brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation) if you\u2019re looking for a horde of single, eligible women all looking for friendship-maybe-more in one convenient place, try a dating site. Nowhere in his advice does Dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it. This attitude is why I and countless other women have been been chased down the street, followed home, physically restrained, spat at, verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage, merely for trying to exist. Put Dan\u2019s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw-drop factor: \"Shopkeepers may lock their doors at night, but if you want a pint of milk, just hammer on the door until they open up. They\u2019ll be flattered.\" In his scenario, Jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling. Him: F*** YOU, YOU STUCK UP B****, I DIDN\u2019T FANCY YOU ANYWAY. You can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It\u2019s going to be quite a ride. According to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a \"cool guy\". Mr Bacon clearly has trouble spelling. It begins with a \u2018t\u2019, Dan. But back to Dan: Points 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3. With \"advice\" like this out there, it\u2019s hardly any surprise, is it? These lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. So imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn\u2019t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook."}

{"pred": "But some games capture the imaginations of gamers more than others, and sometimes those games seem like they\u2019ll never come out. Here are five games that have either been announced or strongly implied, games that people are chomping at the bit to play \u2014 games we\u2019ve been waiting on for a very long time. Making video games is many things, but easy isn\u2019t one of them. Depending on the scope of the project, a single game can take hundreds of people several years to build. And with fickle markets and studios losing funding, even after a game is announced, there\u2019s still a chance it will be canceled like these promising games. 5. Beyond Good & Evil 2 If there\u2019s one game more famous for not existing than The Last Guardian, it\u2019s Half-Life 3. If you haven\u2019t played the other Half-Life games, you might be wondering what the big deal is. First off, it\u2019s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story. In fact, the series really laid the groundwork for all story-based shooters to come. It\u2019s no stretch to say that the original Half-Life was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all. Well, Final Fantasy, once the leading series of Japanese role-playing games, has fallen on somewhat hard times. The 13th installment in particular didn\u2019t exactly light the world on fire. In fact, most fans of the series would agree that it\u2019s been a slow downhill slide since Final Fantasy X came out in 2001. Developer Square Enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a Big Important Game for the series\u2019 15th installment. And judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside Final Fantasy Type-O HD, they\u2019re on the right track. Will the finished product live up to expectations? For that, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. 3. Final Fantasy XV 4. Kingdom Hearts 3 Fun fact: The game that\u2019s currently called Final Fantasy XV began under the title Final Fantasy XIII Versus, which was first shown to the public way back in 2006. Here we are closing in on a decade later, and this game still hasn\u2019t made it to market. What\u2019s going on? The original Kingdom Hearts came out for PlayStation 2 in 2002 and has seen seven sequels in the interim. So it\u2019s kind of strange that the series hasn\u2019t managed to produce a third official installment, instead sticking to prequels, remakes, and \u2014 some would say \u2014 filler. Never fear. A third installment is on its way, and it\u2019s coming only to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. No release date has been set, but have faith that this one will actually happen. Many longtime PlayStation gamers have a strong connection to the works of Team Ico. So far, the developer has only released two titles, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, but they\u2019re both singular, beautiful games that have made a lasting impression. The Last Guardian is Team Ico\u2019s next project, first announced with this trailer in 2009. The game was scheduled to come out in 2011, but it never made it to market. For a certain segment of fans, the Kingdom Hearts games are a dream come true. They combine beloved Disney characters with fan favorites from Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy series. If you happen to fit into the target audience, chances are you\u2019re well aware of this long-running series. Making matters worse, however, is that the last installment, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, which came out in 2007, ended on a major cliffhanger. But instead of continuing that series and playing off that story\u2019s big ol\u2019 hanging thread, Valve shifted its efforts to the (also excellent) Portal series. By now the demand for Half-Life 3 has reached such a fever pitch that even if Valve does eventually deliver the game, it couldn\u2019t possibly live up to expectations. But do us a solid anyway, Valve \u2014 give us Half-Life 3! Fans finally got a fresh look at the game at E3 2015, and some members of the press have even been able to play small chunks of it. Despite assurances that it\u2019ll launch in 2016, many fans are still skeptical. 1. Half-Life 3 The game was originally planned to be the first installment of a trilogy, but poor sales put a wrench in those gears. Still, the game was well-received by critics, and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008. In the years since, an HD remake of the original came out in 2011, but we haven\u2019t heard much about the purported sequel. Is it still in the works? Will it really see the light of day? We may have a while more to wait before we know for sure. The original Beyond Good & Evil came out in 2003. It\u2019s a unique game that stars Jade, an investigative reporter who\u2019s working on a case about a planet-wide alien conspiracy. She can kick serious butt when the situation dictates, but she\u2019s also known to stop and photograph the fauna when she has a free moment. When we might see it: Ubisoft maintains that this game is in development and will be released sometime this console generation. According to one rumor, it could be an NX exclusive. 2. The Last Guardian When we might see it: Hopefully by 2017. When we might see it: No idea, and there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s in development. When we might see it: November 29, 2016 When we might see it: Sometime in 2016... hopefully."}

However, it's easy to interpret this as a criticism of Trump. His comments about Mexicans and Muslims have been deemed by many as isolationist and xenophobic , and he has been accused of exploiting voters' anger and frustration to rise to the rank of frontrunner. A spokesperson for the former First Family denied speculation that Bush was supporting Clinton, telling CBS , \"They are definitely trying to make this into something it isn\u2019t.\" Some are saying that Laura Bush can now be counted in that category. When the former First Lady, and wife of George W. Bush, appeared at last week's Women in the World summit, she outlined the qualities she thinks make a good presidential candidate. \"I want our next president\u2014whoever he or she might be\u2014to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue U.S. policies,\" Bush said. She added that the candidate should \"pay attention to our history, and know what's happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.\" Though she was careful not to name names, some news outlets, including the Telegraph , have speculated that she was referring to Hillary Clinton who worked to improve lives of women in developing countries during her time as Secretary and State. Clinton also wrote a cover endorsement for We Are Afghan Women: Voices of Hope , Bush's recently published book. There is already a substantial list of Republicans who would rather stay home on Election Day, or even vote for Hillary Clinton, than cast their ballot for Donald Trump. The U.S. has a tendency \"to become sort of isolationist and xenophobic,\" Bush continued. \"I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.\""}

{"pred": "Is Buying Organic Really Worth It? So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key. Organic on a budget \"When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,\" she told HuffPost. \"Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.\" Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it? Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth\u2019s well-being, too. \"Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,\" he said. \"It\u2019s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.\" Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large. Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just \"buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.\" \"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email. 4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health. But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit. Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. \"The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,\" said Lu. Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic. 2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce. Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones. For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable. What the heck does organic mean anyway? There\u2019s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an \"excuse to charge more.\" Many organic farms are small operations, though \"big organic\" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce. 5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience. Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. Live in a small apartment? The Urban Organic Gardener website's got you covered. When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data. She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible. Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects. Indeed, there\u2019s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are. The Centers for Disease Control notes that \"[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health\" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue. \"Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,\" wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.\u2019s Newcastle University. \"But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.\" The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds. \"It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,\" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University\u2019s Pancreas Center, in a blog post. Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said. Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not. Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed. \"Some companies aren\u2019t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,\" she said. Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products. When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says \"100 percent organic\" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. \"Organic,\" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while \"made with organic ingredients\" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients. \"Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,\" said Gerszberg. A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and \"substantially higher\" levels of antioxidants. 3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too. Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation. The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health. Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative. A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids. In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency. \"We\u2019re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,\" said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports\u2019 Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. \"It\u2019s not realistic to expect we wouldn\u2019t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don\u2019t know enough about the health effects.\" Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation. \"The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,\" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. \"Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.\" According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled. Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects. According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that\u2019s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers. Other ways of measuring \"worth\": \"Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,\" the nonprofit writes. The Environmental Working Group's \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen\" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The \"clean\" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower. As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut. It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less. 1. Prioritize your purchases. So, what does this mean for human health?

{"pred": "Colorado Is The Most Magical State In America Not convinced? Maybe these 19 reasons will prove that Colorado is the most magical state in America. The state is an adrenaline junkie's paradise. Colorado consistently ranks among the best craft brew states in America. The state has more than 200 breweries, including 130 microbreweries, according to USA Today's 2013 count. Denver itself has more than 20 breweries. If you're an urbanite, a mountaineer, a ski bum, a history nerd, an outdoor adventurer... you get the point... there is something for you in Colorado. And if you're not dazzled by the epic natural wonders Colorado has to offer, you might not have a soul. Both in-state residents and visitors (over 21-years-old) can shop at the dispensaries, though Coloradans can purchase more product than tourists. And these shops don't just sell weed... they sell marijuana-infused edibles, oils, beverages and more. If you fancy yourself a consumer of marijuana, you will be in heaven. Keep in mind, you can only smoke in private, buy from licensed dispensaries and cannot bring marijuana products out of the state. As far as U.S. natural wonders go, this is a must see. The National Natural Landmark offers beautiful rock formations and other archeological wonders. Whether you're into skiing, hiking, climbing, driving or just looking at pretty scenery, the Rocky Mountains are easily one of America's greatest natural wonders. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most visited national parks, for good reason. Breathtaking views are guaranteed, whether the mountains are blanketed in snow or lush green trees. 3. Colorado is a beer-lover's happy place. 1. Because with \"300 days of sunshine,\" Colorado is one of the sunniest places in America. You can't beat these numbers -- Colorado boasts four national parks, 42 state parks, 11 national forests, two national grasslands and eight national wildlife refuges. There's always another trail to hike or mountain to climb... could you ever be bored? There's a reason \"Rocky Mountain High\" is one of Colorado's official state songs. Because regardless of your feelings on legalized pot, Colorado will leave you feeling absolutely magical. Colorado has the highest average elevation in the country. The lowest point in Colorado, located at the Arikaree River, is 3,315 feet above sea level. The highest is Mt. Elbert, located at 14,433 feet above sea level. Denver, the state's capital, legitimately earns its nickname of \"Mile High City\" standing at an elevation of 5,280 feet high. At these elevations, the sun is stronger. You also could potentially get drunk faster. Beer is cheap, ice cream is in abundance and the cost of living won't leave you totally broke. Denver is also near plenty of outdoor adventure, so urbanites can escape from the city whenever their hearts desire. These cool little old-school mining towns look like they're out of a movie (or Snow White, maybe?). Most people associate the gold rush with California, but let's not forget Pike's Peak and Colorado's role in the fun. Follow the Colorado Gold Trail and pass through gold and silver mine towns like Idaho Springs, Breckenridge and Black Hawk. Mine tours are also available in many towns as well. 12. Colorado's welcome signs are cooler than yours. It's been called one of the best amphitheaters in America. If you can't get concert tickets, visiting by day and hiking a trail or having a picnic is a great way to experience Red Rocks. 7. Or visit the Flatirons, which are some of the coolest looking foothills you'll ever see. 15. Because you can walk into a recreational marijuana dispensary and buy marijuana, legally. 13. Denver is mecca for all things delicious, fun and cheap. 19. And, if you haven't figured it out yet, Colorado is paradise for the outdoorsy type. 8. Winding mountain roads are basically nature's roller coaster. 4. Because, the Rockies. While it's up for debate where the original smashburger came from, Smashburger as we know it today is Denver born and bred. Denver is also home to the first ever Chipotle... which is pretty cool, though you can eat Chipotle pretty much anywhere these days. Well, nature provided the mountain. Man built the road. But still, driving up and then down a mountain is an experience every thrill-seeker should experience, and the Rockies are perfect for it. Try Loveland Pass for steep climbs, hairpin turns and views that will make both your stomach and jaw drop. The home of the Colorado Rockies is consistently ranked as one of the top ballparks in the country. And the ballpark's not just for fans -- the over-the-top stadium offers plenty to eat and drink, and sweeping views of Denver and the mountains beyond. Tickets start as low as $4, so it's a great deal. 5. You can rock out surrounded by rocks at Red Rocks Amphitheater. The Flatirons are located in Boulder and have a rich climbing history. They're cool to view from afar and the climbs themselves offer terrific views and some challenging routes. 6. Or spend some heavenly time at Garden of the Gods. 16. Colorado is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command... And you know what they do, right? 9. Travel back in time and visit gold rush and mining towns. They track Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, duh. 11. Coors Field is not just a place to watch baseball. 10. Denver's homegrown burger chain, Smashburger, is beyond delicious. And who doesn't love a sunny day? The \"300 days of sunshine\" thing is actually a myth. According to the Colorado Climate Center, there's no technical definition of \"days of sunshine,\" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome. 14. And Boulder is a haven for crunchy types with no shortage of activity, and awesome proximity to nature, of course. 2. Being at a high altitude just makes things more fun. 17. Want some thrills? How about white water rafting? Zip lining? Ice climbing? Hang gliding? 18. Because Colorado sets records... Zombie Crawl records, that is. 11. Or, if you're feeling really adventurous, you could always try Rocky Mountain Oysters. Warning: Rocky Mountain Oysters are not actually oysters. They are bull testicles and they are a delicacy...we kid you not."}

{"pred": "Business has been so brisk at the world's most profitable toymaker that Lego did something unusual last year: It began looking for ways to discourage customers from buying its products. The efforts to quell demand seem to have worked - at least temporarily. Sales in the Americas remained flat during the first half of 2016, according to the news agency. (Revenue in Asia and Europe, meanwhile, continued to grow by double digits.) Overall, Lego's revenue rose 11 per cent to roughly $US2.35 billion in the first half of the year, ahead of the $US1.83 billion reported by Mattel, the maker of Barbie. Lego, a family-owned company founded in Denmark in 1932, has enjoyed booming growth for decades. The company has released thousands of sets of its eponymous blocks, forging licensing deals with popular brands including Star Wars, Angry Birds and Disney Princesses. It has also taken on iconic architecture: A 2989-piece model of the Sydney Opera house is for sale on Lego's website for $399.99, while a 561-piece White House set sells for $89.99. A replica of the Ghostbusters firehouse, meanwhile, is listed for $499.99. Link Everything has been a bit too awesome for the world's most profitable toymaker, which is struggling to keep up with demand for its building blocks. And the company's dominance has extended into the company's seven Legoland theme parks, 125 retail stores and dozens of video games. The Lego Movie, a full-length movie released in 2014, brought in $US468.2 million ($610.4 million) at the box office. The company is buildings its first factory in China, and is expanding existing plants in Mexico, Hungary and Denmark. Lego also hired 3500 employees in the first half of the year, increasingly its workforce to 18,500, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Danish company scaled back its advertising efforts amid a 25 per cent rise in annual sales, according to Reuters. It simply couldn't make enough toys to satiate demand in North America, and needed a break while it boosted capacity at its factories and increased its workforce by nearly a quarter. \"We feel we need to invest, to build some breathing space,\" Lego's finance chief John Goodwin explained. But executives at Lego are hoping to ramp up production in time for this year's Christmas season, Goodwin said: \"In the past decade we have seen LEGO sales growth in the double digits year after year,\" Goodwin said in a statement in October. \"We are of course very excited about this development. [But] the high demand also puts a strain on our factories around the world.\" \"We are working very closely with our retail partners to ensure that as we go into the important holiday season, the back half of 2016, that we've got all of the levers pulled to get back on the growth trajectory.\" The company's revenue has increased by an average of 15 per cent a year in the past 12 years, according to Reuters.

{"pred": "Steven Spielberg promises one big thing for Indiana Jones 5 With the 73-year-old Harrison Ford signed up for Lucasfilm\u2018s Indiana Jones 5, many fans are wondering/worried that director Steven Spielberg plans to have the same fate of Han Solo in The Force Awakens befall our favorite globe-trotting archaeologist. Well worry no longer, as the legendary filmmaker has told The Hollywood Reporter that he is not only \"super excited\" about the fifth installment but that adventure will still have a name at the end of the movie and that name will be Indiana Jones! \"I think this one is straight down the pike for the fans,\" said Spielberg, who would not reveal plot details, with one exception: \"The one thing I will tell you is I\u2019m not killing off Harrison [Ford] at the end of it.\" That\u2019s great news for fans who would likely balk at such an idea, the same way they would be furious if James Bond accidentally slipped in the shower and cracked his skull at the end of a (hypothetical) final 007 movie. Even if this turns out to be the last time Ford puts on the bullwhip and fedora, it doesn\u2019t mean the filmmakers have to have the death-defying character bite the dust. \"The opportunity to work with Steven again on this character which has brought pleasure to so many...

{"pred": "Courtesy of Netflix Stranger Things Netflix officially announced that a second season of Stranger Things will premiere in 2017. Until then you\u2019ll have to hold onto your wrist rockets, but The Duffer Brothers did give Entertainment Weekly teasers about the show to get everyone all jacked up for the new season. Watch the teaser above, and here\u2019s what we know so far. 7. It will be nine episodes instead of eight. This way, fans can spend nine hours without moving in front of the screen, because life is fair. \"We\u2019re letting the story dictate it,\" says Matt. \"I think if it gets any longer, it gets unwieldy for us. We want to make sure it\u2019s manageable and we want to be able to tell a movie-like story where it\u2019s never treading water. We want it to have the same feel and pacing as season 1. I think if we extend it too much, it will have a very different feel.\" 6. Everyone will still have access to the Upside Down. Great news, in case they want to go hang with the throat snakes for a fun long weekend for the whole family. There will be more discussion of the otherworld and some loose ends will be tied and the creators even posed some questions because a good teacher never keeps a curiosity door locked. They assure us the show will answer some long-marinating questions. \"We obviously have this gate to another dimension, which is still very much open in the town of Hawkins. And a lot of questions there in terms of, if the Monster is dead, was it a singular monster? What else could be out there? We really don\u2019t go in there much until they go in to find Will at the end. So we\u2019ve opened up this doorway, and to us it\u2019s exciting to talk about, like, what else is behind there? There\u2019s a lot more mystery there to be solved.\" 3. Expect four brand new characters. \"There\u2019s going to be a lot of new and interesting dynamics that we didn\u2019t see in season 1,\" Matt Duffer says. In the teaser, we see the words \"The Lost Brother.\" So fingers crossed Barb\u2019s mom can lose one more kid the show can drop like a bad habit, in case that family didn\u2019t endure enough misery. 5. Good old monster-infested Hawkins won\u2019t be the only location. Season two will open on another town, the creators reveal. (It\u2019s conceivable that the Byers\u2019 and co. wanted to have a new beginning in a town without terrifying government operatives at every turn, but given that adorable little William coughs up a slug at the end, they\u2019re not escaping the past anytime soon.) It will be a continuation of the first season\u2019s story. \"I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it\u2019s a different decade,\"Ross Duffer revealed to 2.\"I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it\u2019s a different decade,\"Ross Duffer revealed to EW . \"That\u2019s something we batted around from the very beginning.

I guess a lot of this is James Cameron. But he\u2019s brilliant.

{"pred": "I ask because you\u2019ve directed a handful of \"Mad Men\" episodes. The dark comedy needs a better adjective than \"dark,\" because most of the film reveals deeply-rooted sadness, disappointment and failures \u2013- carried out to perfection by a dream-team cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christina Hendricks, Richard Jenkins and John Turturro. Slattery has directed five episodes of \"Mad Men\" but this is his first attempt at a feature. Based on the theater\u2019s applause on opening night, his future as a director certainly looks bright. After years of playing Roger Sterling on AMC\u2019s \"Mad Men,\" John Slattery is comfortable with a drink in his hand. Sitting on a leather couch in Park City, Utah with a Bloody Mary by his side, Slattery talks less about the ad men of the 1960s and more about the first film that he directed, \"God\u2019s Pocket,\" which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival. You mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different. What do you think you bring to the table now? I\u2019m interested in Zach taking 10 years to do this. I\u2019m sure there are all kinds of reasons \u2013- he was acting, he was being successful in all kinds of ways. I\u2019d like to try it sometime, but you\u2019d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn\u2019t feel like \"Oh I shouldn\u2019t have done this.\" Did you consider acting in the film? Half the time. For \"Mad Men\" we\u2019re in New York so I have a place I go surfing in Long Island. Then I mentioned it to Christina because I was directing an episode of \"Mad Men\" and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person. I hadn\u2019t gotten Phil to officially commit yet so I said here\u2019s the script, I\u2019d love you to play this part and I hope to get Phil. She was thrilled. I sent it to Richard Jenkins who is represented by my agent. About 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. And then John Turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. I was just floored. It sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way. When you\u2019re sitting around, like actors do, and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet, I would do this. At the end of the day, I\u2019d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and I wouldn\u2019t feel crazy that day. I read the book by Pete Dexter about 10 years ago and tried to get the rights to it. But it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t get the rights, because I probably wouldn't be able to actually make a good movie then. I tried getting the rights but someone else owned them. So I let it go. Another example of directors starring in movies is here at Sundance \u2013- Zach Braff\u2019s new film \"Wish I Was Here.\" How did you cast this film? Did you just ask Christina Hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie? Like Woody Allen, I mean I would never even put myself in the same stratosphere, but he is Woody Allen. He knows what he knows and he has the time he has. Ben Affleck -- I have to say, I admire the hell out of that guy with a move like \"Argo.\" To direct it and then give that kind of performance. I don\u2019t know how the hell he dealt with that stress. I was making \"The Adjustment Bureau\" at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day. So it was like are you going to watch TV or do this? When I was told I couldn\u2019t have it, I thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven\u2019t done anything with it I\u2019m just going to write it anyway. And if someone else makes it first, fine. Eventually Bob Gersh from The Gersh Agency worked out the deal. After you had put all that time into it! About five years later, someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book? Turns out the rights were then available. So I said, all right I\u2019m going to outline this thing, because I had written a shitty screenplay in between and I didn\u2019t want to do that again. I did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. I said, okay let\u2019s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. The rights were not available. Same people still owned it. I think just seeing more of everything. Life. You get to a point where you\u2019re young and you\u2019re an actor and everything is always about \"if I could just get this,\" \"if I could only get that.\" And then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain. This is what I do well. I don\u2019t do everything well. I can\u2019t play everything. I\u2019m not a movie star. I don\u2019t want to be a movie star. Your aspirations become more your own. And then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively. You watch other people do their thing and you think, \"I could do this. I can try at this.\" What did you find most compelling about the material in \"God\u2019s Pocket\"? What made you want to make this film? You also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing. There\u2019s actor A, B, C and then there\u2019s Phil Hoffman. And Richard Jenkins and Christina Hendricks and John Turturro. And the fact that they said yes . The Huffington Post joined Slattery couch-side to find out why it took 10 years to make this happen, how surfing keeps him from getting \"a little screwy\" and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time. It\u2019s very visual, which appealed to me. I sort of see things in pictures -- I don\u2019t know whether that makes me dumb or smart. Like a kid almost. And the dialogue, by which I mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. It was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything. Do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn\u2019t have it at first? I went to Phil [Seymour Hoffman] first. You go through the proper channels because you don\u2019t want to burden anybody with \"do me a favor.\" That\u2019s a drag. I sent him the script and I anticipated that he would let me down easy and say I like it but I don\u2019t have time. I had sent it with an offer for the part of Shelburne. He called and said, \"I love the script, but I want to play Mickey.\" And it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was. So I said all right, in. It\u2019s the same if I were acting in a play or directing. Creative people go on vacation and four days in you\u2019re like I gotta get out of here. I have a lot of energy, so I\u2019m told. I surf a lot. There\u2019s a scene where Christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. She slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film. [Warning: plot spoilers throughout] Do you have a different itch that\u2019s satisfied by writing versus acting? What I think you get from Christina\u2019s performance is the disappointment she feels. He\u2019s not picking up on the signals of what she needs, you see them having sex and obviously that\u2019s not going very well. He can\u2019t express himself. And she needs something. She needs to find out what happened to her son. She needs him to step up and do the right thing, and he\u2019s trying but they\u2019re missing each other. That\u2019s the least sort of fun of the whole thing -\u2013 being in it. Some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene, have done your homework, know the lines, and you sit down and it can be really fun. Because you know what you\u2019re doing on one side of the camera and know what you\u2019re doing on the other. But when it really comes down to it, it\u2019s because you recognize what they do. You really recognize what they\u2019re capable of doing and I should be so lucky to be able to work with those guys. John Slattery's 'God's Pocket' Shows That Seriously Everyone Wants To Work With Him Isn\u2019t that freezing? She condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. What I wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency.

He feels that if I lose this woman then I\u2019ll never get anybody else like that. I think there\u2019s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it. So even though she might not be in love with him anymore, he doesn\u2019t really belong in this place, he has no affinity for this place, he just has this woman. No. I got asked if I was going to, and every time I said no, people were like, \"good idea.\" [laughs] Which I was like, \"what the hell do you mean by that?\" In the winter it is.

Buying a used car comes with some risks: Despite all the inspections and certifications, you\u2019re forever a little curious about what the car went through before you put the key in the ignition for the first time. But what one guy found inside the used car he had recently purchased goes beyond what anyone\u2019s wildest imagination could conjure up. The guy bought a used car through the local police department, thinking he\u2019d get a great deal on a car that had been confiscated. When he tore through the plastic on the inside of the door, he noticed something... The car needed some fixing, so in order to save money, he tried to do the repairs himself. A black bag, hidden inside. He chose to hide his identity for obvious reasons. Probably a smart move. The buyer initially posted his story anonymously online, but later deleted the post out of fear that the previous owner would be able to track him down. Unwrapping them revealed the last thing he\u2019d ever expected to find: stacks upon stacks of bills. Inside the bag were brick-like objects covered in tape. As in, money. Lots of it. What would you do if something like this ever happened to you? I, for one, would load up on lotto tickets. And by \"load up on lotto tickets,\" I mean turn the money over to the authorities, of course."}

The man drove recklessly for nearly an hour, hitting an armored car and another vehicle. At one point, he looked up and waved at TV choppers broadcasting the chase. He ended up in the hills above Whittier, along Turnbull Canyon Road. But a driver escaping from a pursuit is much more rare. And it appeared to happen Friday \u2014 at least for a while. There, he slowed his vehicle in a tree-covered section of the road. As the Honda Accord kept moving, he climbed almost imperceptibly out of the driver\u2019s window. The vehicle coasted to a stop farther down the road. Televised police chases are pretty common in Los Angeles. Some chase observers gave the man points for ingenuity because his escape was difficult to see live.

{"pred": "Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health. Maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy experimenting and growing. By appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don\u2019t achieve the ultimate goal. As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article \"Small Wins,\" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions: As humans, we tend to set goals throughout our entire lives and dedicate most of our time trying to achieve them. That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals. By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal. From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement \u2014 reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn\u2019t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends. The Dangers of Dreaming Big We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety. Step 3: Reward yourself Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself \u2014 with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions. The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins: Our sense of self-worth can be worsened We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can\u2019t be achieved Step 2: Reflect often We are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal. For every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear: Step 1: Start small First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day\u2019s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem. Step 4: Enjoy the process Love this article?

{"pred": "Taxes on cigarettes are rising yet again in Chicago with a 50-cent increase that makes smokes in the Windy City the most highly-taxed in the country. Cigarette Tax Hike In Chicago Makes A Pack Of Smokes In The Windy City The Priciest In The Nation \"The cheaper the cigarettes, the more people who are going to buy cigarettes and the more people who are going to die,\" the American Heart Association\u2019s Mark Peysakhovich told the Sun-Times the day before the City Council vote. In combination with state and local taxes, the city tax increase pushes the total taxes on cigarettes sold in the city to $7.17 a pack, WGN reports. Chicago's per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than New York City\u2019s $6.86 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation. Ald. Jason Ervin (28th) said regardless of the mayor's decision to budge on the taxes, the high rate is likely to push smokers to purchase packs outside the city. Chicago's City Council overwhelmingly approved the cigarette tax hike as part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel's 2014 budget on Tuesday. Though the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from Mayor Emanuel. The mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards. The city, however, is still cracking down on smoking in other ways: Emanuel and a few key aldermen are reportedly looking to heavily restrict e-cigarette use in the city with rules that would effectively ban them from public spaces. Health officials, meanwhile, were dismayed that the tax on cigarettes wasn't higher. According to Emanuel's budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the Tribune reports. The $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the city's two airports. \"We still create the black market when we raise that bar at any level,\" Ervin told the Sun-Times."}
{"pred": "'The Sexy Lie' We Should Be Talking About: Sexual Objectification \"I'd like to talk specifically about the lie, or the idea, that being a sex object is empowering.\" \"I am here today to talk about a lie.\" That's how politics professor Caroline Heldman opened her Jan. 2013 TEDxYouth San Diego talk on the topic of sexual objectification. Does the image show only parts of a sexualized person's body? Does the image present a sexualized person as a stand-in for an object? Does the image show a sexualized person as interchangeable? Does the image affirm the idea of violating the bodily integrity of a sexualized person that can't consent? Does the image suggest that sexual availability is the defining characteristic of the person? Does the image show a sexualized person as a commodity? Does the image treat a sexualized person's body as a canvas? Heldman explained that sexual objectification is so common that many young people struggle to even recognize it as such: \"It's like being raised in a red room, being pulled out of that room, and asked to describe the color red.\" She added that girls may grow up believing that being objectified is actually empowering because American culture teaches that to be a sex object is to be valuable. Instead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective. A spectator's perspective, where you're worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure. So if there's anything I can pitch to you about why you don't want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure. However, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to Heldman: Heldman drew on the work of others to create a 7-step test to determine if an image is sexually objectifying. An image is sexually objectifying if \"yes\" is the answer to any of the following questions: Perhaps the most powerful part of the video is the end, where Heldman invites us to \"imagine a different world,\" offering viewers tools to navigate, and eventually, change objectification culture. We highly recommend watching."}
{"pred": "Read Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer's firsthand account of his four months spent working as a guard at a corporate-run prison in Louisiana. To see what private prisons are really like, Shane Bauer applied for a job with the Corrections Corporation of America. He used his own name and Social Security number, and he noted his employment with the Foundation for National Progress, the publisher of Mother Jones. He did not lie. He spent four months as a guard at a CCA-run Louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking. We took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons\u2014often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates\u2014dramatically reduced. There is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there. When the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception. Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed. There is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there. Bly\u2014who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best Jules Verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days\u2014was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. Or the last. Ted Conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did Ben Bagdikian, for whom MoJo's fellowship program is named. In 1961, John Howard Griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and Walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. Mac McClelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for Mother Jones. But while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. Why? First, there's a real concern over ethics. When is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? There's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by Poynter ethicist Bob Steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. I'll paraphrase: Or when, for that matter, they replace the government. When CCA (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of US taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that Shane had \"knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to CCA by violating its policies,\" and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. The letter came not from CCA's in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-LGBT activities. When he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us. When the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story. In 1887, a 23-year-old journalist got herself checked into the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island in New York City. When she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, \"lunatics\" treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants. Serialized by Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, Nellie Bly's accounts (later collected in a book called Ten Days in a Mad-House) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck\u2014she'd begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled \"What Girls Are Good For\"\u2014though her inge\u0301nue looks couldn't have hurt, either. But despite prose that shades purple to today's ears, Bly's work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: It prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she'd proposed, including a $26 million (in today's dollars) increase to the budget of the city's Department of Public Charities and Correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed. If you think stories like this need to be told, please make a tax-deductible donation to Mother Jones to help underwrite our investigations. Shane's story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed. But don't let anyone distract you from the story itself. Because the story itself is revealing as hell. But here's the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. When ABC News busted Food Lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company's line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters' failure to fulfill their assigned duties\u2014i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! The $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. Nondisclosure agreements\u2014once mainly the provenance of people who work on Apple product launches and Beyonce\u0301 videos\u2014are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other \"non-disparagement\" clauses and \"employer protection statutes.\" Somewhere along the way, employers' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny\u2014even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government. Companies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny. When the information obtained is of vital public interest. When other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted. After meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues. When the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused."}
{"pred": "And yet the vegetable American toddlers are most likely to eat is a french fry. Experts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese American adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems. Advocates said they were pleased the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services have started to develop the first-ever dietary guidelines for children under the age of 2, but those standards are not expected until 2020. The panel and congressional leaders highlighted the need for legislation about increased nutritional information and paid family leave. The report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don\u2019t receive enough iron in their diet. Child health advocates gathered on Capitol Hill Wednesday to mark the release of a new report, \"The First 1,000 Days: Nourishing America\u2019s Future,\" which documents the scourge of malnutrition in the U.S. Bush echoed those calls to action, stressing that America\u2019s children need access to these fundamental nutrients as they grow. The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America. Lucy Sullivan, Executive Director of 1,000 Days \"Half of the babies born in this country are participating in Women, Infants and Children program here in the United States,\" Lucy Sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 Days, said on Capitol Hill Wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as WIC. 1,000 Days, a nonprofit that advocates nationally and globally for better early nutrition, produced the report, which highlights the economic gap that prevents many families from meeting some of the World Health Organization\u2019s basic nutritional standards. Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) echoed Bush: \"These children are losing the chance to reach their full potential before they even get started.\" \"That\u2019s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the U.S. that maybe looks like the population of a developing country,\" she added. \"It is all of us. The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America.\" \"This has to be a commitment to putting kids, and their need for access to food and nutrition, in the front of the agenda,\" Casey said. He called for a Marshall Plan for the children of America, much like the billions of dollars in economic support the U.S. gave to Europe after WWII. Nutrition during the 1,000 days between a child\u2019s conception and their second birthday is critical to their future success, dictating both brain and physical development. Barbara Bush, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps, stressed the irreversibility of the first 1,000 days. In the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life, the brain needs the proper mix of nutrients to fully form. Without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child\u2019s brain may never form all its potential synapses. They can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs. \"The most devastating part is when you are 2 years old and younger, you don\u2019t have a lot of control over your life,\" she said. \"But it can have an impact on your life in perpetuity.\" The report highlights a number of factors: Nearly half of U.S. women gain an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy, which can lead to higher rates of obesity in children. And only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the WHO recommends due to breastmilk\u2019s unparalleled nutritional properties. Those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed. That doesn\u2019t even begin to address all the economic factors at play. Hugh Welsh, the president of DSM, a major global producer of vitamins, minerals and nutrition supplements, highlighted the lack of understanding in the U.S. about the dire need for a well-balanced mix of vitamins and nutrients. \"I could travel to Malawi, and everyone there would understand, but I could travel to Milwaukee and no one would understand what I was talking about with micronutrients,\" he said. \"You can\u2019t catch up,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"It will impact everything you do, whether that be how you learn or if you can learn fully and all of your mechanisms to engage in life.\" Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said the issue requires bipartisan action."}
{"pred": "A Shocking Find in a Neanderthal Cave in France These weren\u2019t natural formations, and they weren\u2019t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site\u2019s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn\u2019t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They\u2019ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn\u2019t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\" And if Rouzaud\u2019s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden\u2019s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn\u2019t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren\u2019t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that\u2019s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn\u2019t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren\u2019t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. \"The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,\" the team writes. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France\u2019s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski\u2019s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary\u2014a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings\u2014a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones. She knew that Rouzaud\u2019s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique\u2019s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I\u2019m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It\u2019s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave\u2019s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins\u2014collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient."}

{"pred": "And because the lesson has not been learned, another simple truth has come forward: The Cavaliers cannot win these NBA Finals. How do the Cavs win a game in this series? It certainly appears that it's going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so \u2014 the kind of changes that look beyond Lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the \"tougher plays\" as the reasons behind his team's blowout loss Sunday. The Cavaliers have been taught the simple truth seven times now \u2014 all Warriors wins \u2014 and yet they have not come to the understanding that they cannot take 2s and expect to beat 3s. It has to do with the Warriors' elite defense. It has to do with the Warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It has to do with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. It has to do with the Cavs needing J.R. Smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. It has to do with the Cavs daring Draymond Green to beat them and then him doing just that. It has to do with Cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time. The Warriors have now won seven consecutive games against the Cavs \u2014 three straight to claim last season's title, twice in the 2015-16 regular season, and now twice in these NBA Finals \u2014 and in each effort, the Cavs have found themselves further and further from victory. The Cavs then saw the simple truth play out twice more in the regular season. The Cavs clearly haven't learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, it's too late for them to do anything about it. The Cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in NBA Finals history \u2014 the Warriors' 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games \u2014 and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls. If anything, the Warriors have given the Cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: In Game 1, the Splash Brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the Warriors only made nine 3-pointers total. In Game 2, Golden State turned the ball over 20 times. The Cavs came into Sunday's game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the Eastern Conference Playoffs with ease. The Warriors made 15 3-pointers while the Cavs made 5 on Sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point Warriors win \u2014 the seventh-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history. Those were windows \u2014 the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the Cavs couldn't take advantage of it. The simple truth loomed too large. It was going to be hard \u2014 coach Tyronn Lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between Games 1 and 2 that it's nearly impossible to create ball movement against the Warriors' defense, which switches assignments at all five positions \u2014 but the Cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory. Instead, the Cavs shot two more 3-pointers in Game 2 compared to Game 1. They made two fewer. Overall, Cleveland is 12-of-44 from beyond the arc in this series, while J.R. Smith, the team's most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the Finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes he's on the court. The Warriors are smothering him, and he's not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one. Then again in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. And again in Game 2 of the NBA Finals Sunday. Nothing about these Warriors' wins has been flukey. This is what they do. They are prolific and ruthless \u2014 a juggernaut of the highest order. Frankly, they'd be lucky to win a game. Not being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as LeBron James said in his postgame press conference \u2014 50-50 balls. It has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2."}
{"pred": "We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa. Eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience. The tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots. What's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there. Marsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said.  \"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we\u2019ve only been open for two days. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said. Though the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.) Waiter-less, cashier-less restaurant is the stuff of the future Her boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It\u2019s almost like a robot\u2019s making it anyways.\" The process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised. Instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse?  While one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\" With the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal. Much like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor \u2014 our mascots, we call them \u2014 and we\u2019re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls. Nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned.  Despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There\u2019s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\" While this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it\u2019s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone\u2019s like woah this is crazy. So it\u2019s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\"  To the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap.  Since there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth. Right before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice. First-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it\u2019s fun that there\u2019s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\" Though I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen. As of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend \u2014 that\u2019s how we make it so fast and so quick.\" The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about. To get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We\u2019re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\" Bryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said. Very ominous. TBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons."}
{"pred": "With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down: As of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings. Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime. It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher. Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115 The Avengers - $1,518,594,910 The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551 Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600 Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774 The Marvel Effect The Marvel Cinematic Universe, or (MCU) is a shared fictional universe focused on a series of superhero films that are based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics. In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases. Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140 Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534 Iron Man - $585,174,222 Iron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910 However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that \"these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie...In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.\" Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331 Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019. Phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.

{"pred": "Fifty-eight percent of adults ages 18 to 24 consider rising student debt levels in the United States a \"major problem,\" according to survey results released exclusively to The Huffington Post on Tuesday by the Harvard University Institute of Politics. Only 3 percent said it's not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a \"minor problem.\" Yet even among people who weren't enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue. NEW YORK -- A majority of young Americans say student debt is a major issue facing the nation, a new poll finds, and many blame colleges for the problem. Many Young Americans Blame Colleges For Rising Student Debt A plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault. Survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school. Young Invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill. O'Sullivan believes the trillion-dollar number has captured the attention of many people, but now it's important to explain why student debt is big and \"what it is we need to fix it.\" However, 32 percent of respondents in the new survey pointed the finger at the federal government, which handles roughly 85 percent of the nation's outstanding student debt. The U.S. Department of Education collected $42.5 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone. The cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment. But policy experts and consumer watchdogs have increasingly flagged the wealth loss and ripple effect that the nation's $1.2 trillion in student debt is having on the economy as a whole. Although O'Sullivan believes there's plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges. Only 8 percent of Harvard's survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt. A 2012 New York Federal Reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts. A previous Huffington Post/YouGov poll found most Americans believe state universities are no longer affordable. \"Young people who are coming of age today understand that getting a postsecondary education is important [but] they have a lot of fear about the rising cost of higher education,\" said Rory O'Sullivan, Policy and Research Director at Young Invincibles, a group that aims to represent young people in policy debates. Matthew Segal, co-founder and head of millennial advocacy nonprofit OurTime.org, was \"pleasantly surprised\" to see that young adults are putting responsibility for the trend with colleges. More than 7 in 10 in the Harvard poll said that their own financial circumstances were an important factor in whether or not they attended college. \"People are finally realizing that the college arms race must stop if we are ever going to rein in costs,\" Segal said. \"We invest less than we used to, per student,\" O'Sullivan noted. \"Too many colleges are acting in the interest of building prestige over providing an affordable pathway to higher learning for their students,\" Segal said. The Huffington Post collaborated with the Harvard Institute of Politics on questions asked of college-age Americans. A larger update to Harvard's biennial study of younger Americans will be publicly released Wednesday. Segal noted that George Washington University, for instance, is currently building a $130 million \"super dorm\" on campus, and students at the University of Pennsylvania are able to dine at a juice bar after hitting up the golf simulator at one of the campus fitness centers. This phenomena of spending resources on extravagant secondary amenities isn't limited to private schools, either: Iowa State University recently spent $46.2 million renovating one of two campus gyms, resulting in a facility equipped with rock walls and hot tubs, while the University of California-Davis offers swimming pools in some residence halls."}

Shadia said her brother was not a member of any terror group and had acted on his own. She added that Qanbar, a father of four, was devoutly religious. \"Praise be to Allah that he became a martyr. It is the most beautiful kind of saintly death,\" Fadi al Qanbar\u2019s sister Shadia, 28, told Palestinian media. At least nine people have been arrested in connection with the attack, mostly members of the Qanbar family. \"Allah chose him for this martyrdom. Thank God. We are patient and we thank Allah for this,\" she added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there are signs Qanbar may have supported the Islamic State.

Qanbar rammed his truck into a crowd of cadets and officers who were touring the promenade overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem in the southern neighborhood of Armon Hanatziv. According to eyewitnesses, after the terrorist ran his flatbed truck over the soldiers, he reversed over them a second time. All four of the soldiers who died were in their twenties, and three of them were women. Hamas spokesman Abdul-Latif Qanou said the truck-ramming attack showed that the wave of Palestinian violent \"resistance\" against Israel has not ceased. \"It may be quiet, it may linger, but it will never end,\" he said."}

The couple have been sending mixed signals to the press and public for almost as long, never providing any affirmative answer. But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben\u2019s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers? Jennifer Garner is seen departing on a flight at LAX airport in Los Angeles, California on June 30, 2016. It was one year ago today that Jennifer announced her split from Ben Affleck but their divorce is still not official. FameFlynet So which is it? Will they or won\u2019t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer? Or is Jen dangling the reconciliation worm before ben and is ben the one who\u2019s being jerked about? Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his \"wife\" as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career. Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary this week and it\u2019s been almost a year since they publicized their separation. The couple is still seen together with their children. Case and point, their family trip to London and Paris last month while Ben Affleck was filming Justice League. Yet another report states that Ben doesn\u2019t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they\u2019ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn\u2019t mind that the divorce hasn\u2019t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it. ET also noted since their split, the two have established a co-parenting routine with ben remaining close to Jen and the kids. Confused? ET did it\u2019s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they\u2019re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted? And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: \"They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other\" They\u2019re still legally married, but separated. They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: \"They\u2019re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.\" People Magazine has published two conflicting stories. One friend of Jennifer\u2019s says: \"nothing has changed\" in the relationship: \"They\u2019re still all about putting the kids first.\" According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don\u2019t know if they will ever get a divorce: \"They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,\" the source reiterates.

I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]...

She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan. \"But people still abandon their dogs.

Shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters. Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short. The shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down. \"She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,\" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers. High kill rate The Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter. Some accused \"higher-level bureaucrats\" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility. In 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness. \"They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we'll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,\" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers. As a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan. Some Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell. From 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (\u00a3100). A new law banning animal euthanasia is set to take force in Taiwan. It comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. The BBC's Cindy Sui explores this tragedy. The authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy. Short-term measures In the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down. But the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed. \"We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,\" said Mr Chiang. \"It's a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem.\" Activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays. The government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures. Taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce. You might also be interested in But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure. But it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the \"beautiful slaughterer\". Ms Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force. \"I went home and cried all night,\" she said. In an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down. Perhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time. And even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered. \"When you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it's very sad.\" Many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law. Newspapers accused the government of \"murdering\" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing. The chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately. No psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan."}

Fans deluged his account with praise for what he had done off the field. One called his donation a selfless act that was way bigger than football. But Watson went the extra yard -- well, way beyond that. He pulled Ava's father aside and told him he was donating a week's paycheck to the family. Menelik Watson of the Oakland Raiders just earned our All-Pro honors -- for incredible generosity. The Raiders were visited recently by Ava Urrea, a 4-year-old who was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome -- which interrupts normal blood flow through the heart. Ava, who has had 14 surgeries, got to hang with the players last week, received a signed helmet and all kinds of goodies and attended the team's game on Dec. 21. It was all arranged through the Touchdown Dreams children's charity run by Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer. On Sunday, Watson didn't tweet about the donation, though he did mention the Raiders' upset victory over the Buffalo Bills. (He did not play.) With Ava in attendance, the Raiders triumphed, 26-24.

Sorry to those who thought it would be. However, don\u2019t be disheartened, as you\u2019re in for a lot of fun. This new hero\u2019s name? Ana. Ana, the kickass heal-sniper. Much like other heroes, Ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it\u2019s a goodie. Turns out she is Pharah\u2019s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the Overwatch team. Ana\u2019s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise. Looking to the future, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Ana affects the game\u2019s balance, and just who, or what, else Blizzard has up their sleeve. Maybe Sombra will make an appearance in a future release? Maybe Sombra was just a complete ruse? Only time will tell. Check out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect. Ana taught Pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. She states in her origin video that she didn\u2019t want the same life for Pharah as she\u2019d had, although I\u2019d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless. Ana\u2019s inclusion adds a truly unique set of skills for players to get their hands on. Now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. You can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper."}

According to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than Google's. But his confident response was shut down by the interviewer. He was offered another chance to think about the question, but he stuck to his guns and was quickly told his answer was incorrect. Partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: \"Sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!\" Prashant Bagdia posted on the website Quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at Microsoft.

{"pred": "The Difference Between a Job and a Calling I\u2019ve learned that work is most fulfilling when it\u2019s a calling. And often, it\u2019s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. And fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. In Corporate Culture and Performance, authors John Kotter and James Heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. But having purpose doesn\u2019t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. Research from the Hay Group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. As a result, I believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you. Granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. Many people start to explore their feelings when they\u2019re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life. But it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. When you\u2019re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, \"What am I doing right now that is making me fulfilled?\" Are you helping someone? Are you coding? Are you being creative? Are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? The answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward. So spend time creating a vision for your life. Ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play. Trust me, your vision can and will change over time. But knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life\u2014in and out of the workplace\u2014is absolutely key to success. And more importantly, it is absolutely key to finding your passion for life. I\u2019ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. Spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. I keep a \"dream book\" myself, and I\u2019ve filled it with things that are important to me\u2014from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. It even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that\u2019s been on my list of projects to tackle\u2014and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today."}

{"pred": "This \"Star Wars\" Theory About Rey Is Insane But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine's granddaughter. The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey's parents? Rey's first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine's fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey's parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now. During Rey's vision, Palpatine can be heard several times. That's because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark. In the film's script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\". There's the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. In the portrait form, Rey's strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they're one. Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine's scream, and further along, there's audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine's inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke's lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol' Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey? Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey's British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it's pretty compelling. The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens. There's even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film's script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. More like Grandpa-lpatine."}

{"pred": "A number of Olympians - including the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, Michael Phelps - have been photographed with large red circles on their skin. Why are some Olympians using it? The mark of an Olympic athlete, at least at Rio 2016, seems to be a scattering of perfectly round bruises. Swimmers and gymnasts, particularly from Team USA, are among those seen sporting the mysterious dots. The marks visible on Michael Phelps as he competed in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay on Sunday had people on social media speculating what they might be, with some guessing he might have been playing paintball or attacked by a giant octopus. Image copyright Ryan Pierse Image caption US swimmer Michael Phelps, winner of 19 Olympic gold medals, sporting cupping bruises on his shoulders and back Belarusian swimmer Pavel Sankovich also posted a photo of his legs covered in a dozen of the little domes. On the other hand, swimmer Michael Phelps was filmed wincing as he underwent the technique in a recent advert , and other Olympians have posted pictures of what look like painful cupping sessions on social media. Image copyright AFP Image caption Michael Phelps sported some particularly pronounced marks Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alex Naddour and other members of the US gymnastics team told USA Today they swear by cupping It's not only athletes who use cupping. The practice has long proved popular among A-listers in search of the next best therapy. No, not paintballing misadventures or love bites - they are the result of a practice known as \"cupping\"; an ancient therapy where heated cups are placed on the skin. The suction pulls the skin away from the body and promotes blood flow - and leaves those red spots, which typically last for three or four days. Justin Bieber, Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Aniston have all been photographed with what look like cupping marks. Athletes say they are using it to ease aches and pains, and to help with recovery from the physical toil of constant training and competing. What are they, and why is everyone suddenly going dotty over them? The British Acupuncture Council (BAcC) says cupping is not painful, and the red marks left on the skin are caused by blood being drawn to the surface and small capillaries rupturing. Practitioners claim cupping helps with a huge variety of ailments from muscle problems to cellulite. There are plenty of other recovery techniques competitors use - including sports massage, sauna, ice baths and compression garments - but US gymnast Alex Naddour told USA Today that cupping was \"better than any money I've spent on anything else\". The BAcC warns that on \"rare occasions\" the hot cups can cause mild burns. It has published rules of practice for cupping, and advises people only to visit properly-trained practitioners who are accredited members of their organisation. His team captain Chris Brooks added that many on the squad had started \"do-it-yourself\" cupping, with cups that can be suctioned with a pump rather than with a flame. Image copyright Pavel Sankovich Instagram Image copyright LFI Image caption Gwyneth Paltrow with cupping marks in 2004 Cupping has also become an increasingly available and popular treatment in beauty parlours and spas, as well as traditional Chinese medicine shops where it is commonly on offer. So how is 'cupping' done? Doesn't it hurt? Who else does this? The technique, which is a form of acupuncture, is done by lighting flammable liquid in a glass cup. Once the flame goes out, the drop in temperature creates suction which sticks the cups to the body. Image copyright Above Average Twitter \"That's been the secret that I have had through this year that keeps me healthy,\" Naddour told the paper, adding that it had saved him from \"a lot of pain\".

While there have \"certainly been satisfied customers for 3,000 years\", Professor Edzard Ernst from the department of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter previously told the BBC it was not a proven medical treatment. So does it actually work? He insisted it was a relatively safe practice, but added: \"There is no evidence for its efficacy. It has not been submitted to clinical trials.\" In 2004, Gwyneth Paltrow appeared at a film premiere revealing the signs of cupping on her back. \"You're like, 'OK, I'm sore here,'\" said Brooks. \"Throw a cup on, and your roommate will help you or you can do it yourself.\" Image copyright Thinkstock"}
{"pred": "Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhum said that the ongoing power shortage was \"intentional\" and aimed \"to tighten the unfair siege on Gaza and create chaos and anarchy\". \"We were shouting from the beginning, 'Peaceful, peaceful, we need electricity',\" he added. \"Thank God I am still alive! I was hit by several punches and blows from the police,\" said Ehab Elmaghraby, a student who took part in the protest. Angry protests in Gaza over crippling power shortages More than 10 years ago, Israel destroyed a large part of the power plant located in central Gaza after the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants. Local and international organisations have suggested numerous solutions over the past decade to solve the crisis, leading to the reconstruction of the destroyed power station. Since then, power shortages have had an impact on almost every aspect of life in Gaza. \"All responsible authorities must co-operate to resolve the electricity crisis immediately,\" he added. The two million residents of Gaza require around 470-500 megawatts of power per day, but at the moment are receiving less than half of that, according to the spokesman for the electricity supplier, Tariq Lubbad. For the last couple of years, people in Gaza receive electricity on alternating eight-hour cycles, but for the last four weeks they have only received a maximum of four hours of power a day from the electricity company - a reduction in supply that has come in the middle of particularly cold weather in Gaza. Barhum demanded that Abbas, and the Fatah movement that he leads, \"end this dangerous policy\" and end the crisis, which has left Gaza with less than a quarter of its required electricity. Hamas security forces, some wearing civilian clothes, then began firing live ammunition into the air and hitting civilians with batons. A video posted on Facebook shows demonstrators marching from the centre of the refugee camp to the headquarters of the electricity company. Nikolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, warned that local residents could not be expected to live with \"just a couple of hours of electricity per day in the middle of winter\". This week security forces of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas have arrested dozens of Gaza residents for participating in protests against cuts to the electricity supply. Tensions and anger are now rising in the Gaza Strip as many are without power for more than 18 hours a day. 'Thank God I am still alive' Hamas security forces violently dispersed the protesters, with shots fired in the air to clear the crowds and a number of protesters and local journalists assaulted. \"I call for the full respect of the right to freedom of expression, peaceful protest and assembly in Gaza,\" Mladenov also said in a statement. On Friday, the Hamas movement held the government of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah in the West Bank, and President Abbas responsible for the dire electricity crisis in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of angry demonstrators have poured onto the streets, protesting against both the local electricity company and the Hamas-run Gaza power authority, demanding an immediate solution. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said that \"security personnel in the aftermath of the protest raided several houses and arrested a number of activists\". The unusual protest near Gaza's most densely populated place - the Jebaliya refugee camp - was one of the largest unauthorised and unplanned protests since Hamas reinforced its power in the strip in 2007, when it removed officials from the Fatah movement. The Associated Press said that one of its journalists was arrested, while a photographer for the French news agency AFP was reportedly hit in the face by a police officer's gun when he refused to hand over his camera. \"I'm no longer able to pay the salaries of my eight workers for the time when we aren't able to work. We are only working for three or four hours a day and this, of course, is not enough,\" Sakallah said. Abu Ziad Sakallah owns a workshop producing household furnishings and can only work for a couple of hours every day. It's not enough to meet his deadlines for orders received. Hamas' police forces arrested dozens of people in northern Gaza for their involvement in the demonstration. The foreign press had been told by Hamas not to cover the event. The photographer had to go to hospital and received stitches for a wound on his face. Since then, there has effectively been a division of the Palestinian territories, with parts of the West Bank controlled by the Palestinian Authority and its Fatah President, Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza governed by Hamas."}
{"pred": "Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. Credit: Eetu Puttonen It depends on how you define \"sleep,\" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said. After a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep? It's unclear if the sun \"woke up\" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But \"the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],\" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science. \"Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,\" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. \"The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].\" The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said. The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said. The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found. In the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (Betula pendula) at night. One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?] The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep. However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said. \"Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,\" said study co-author Andra\u0301s Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?] The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. \"This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,\" Puttonen said. The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said."}

{"pred": "Alina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend\u2019s wedding. The 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. It is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. When weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the \"performance killer\" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot. Fight or Flight or... Sleep? Place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions. The correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in American society. NPR maintains that 60 million Americans are currently battling insomnia. These are, in short, all individual components of the body\u2019s intrinsic and universally acknowledged \"fight-or-flight\" response. Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night. In a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs. Why does stress affect sleep? Stress is widely recognized as the body\u2019s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. Although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. When Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. It did. Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly. Dr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the \"4-7-8 exercise.\" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere. According to an American Psychological Association study titled Stress in America , more than 50 percent of Millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. This is comparable to only 37 percent of Baby Boomers and 25 percent of Matures. \"Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.\" These are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the \"Milliennial Generation,\" which is also sometimes referred to as Generation Y. Recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the Millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless . That being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies. Here is how you do the exercise: Best-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes: Because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath. How to Do The \"4-7-8\u2032\u2032 Exercise Tech savvy . Culturally aware . Underemployed . Spiritual but not religious ."}

{"pred": "Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault? The relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. A string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. In the last two years alone, players from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Florida State University, and the University of Oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. More than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights for sexual violence allegations. But are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they\u2019re the ones accused of committing the crime? Without better data, it\u2019s hard to say anything definitive on the matter. Even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 Philadelphia Daily News article. (One 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) Literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: One recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes. We can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. A 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the National Collegiate Athletic Association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations. Still, the recent investigation at Baylor found that the university\u2019s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally. While members of sports teams \u2014 and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military \u2014 are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. There is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to Laura Finley, a sociologist at Barry University. Finley told Wisconsin Public Radio that players of \"power and performance sports\" \u2014 football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball \u2014 commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. An analysis of National Football League players by Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket. College athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports \u2014 football and hockey, for example \u2014 violent by design. While no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. The recent investigation into Baylor, for example, concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\" And the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. Consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to \"use force\" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions. An investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players. One factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. Anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. Peggy Sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. In other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression. Mr. Starr\u2019s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them. The recent investigation into Baylor concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\" Last week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports: Then-Baylor head coach Art Briles looks on from the sidelines.

{"pred": "\"Here\u2019s the thing,\" says Fisch. \"You can increase the size of your penis \u2014 visually. The way you can do it is by losing weight.\" Bottom line: You can't magically grow a bigger penis... and that's OK. According to a recent analysis of Google data by economist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, the top penis-related search was \"how to make my penis bigger.\" Yes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis that's physically possible for you. But in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who you're sexually compatible with.' Again, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth. Cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer. Obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you\u2019re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet. Another way to look bigger: Trim your pubic hair. That\u2019s usually because they\u2019re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. So the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy \u2014 especially your cardiovascular system. \"What\u2019s good for the heart is good for the penis,\" says Fisch. Now, let\u2019s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis. \"Whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can\u2019t get it bigger than that,\" says Fisch. \"However, a lot of men don\u2019t meet their potential.\" Even those penile extenders and stretchers that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length, and that has absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard, says Fisch. So don\u2019t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inches. \"There\u2019s no actual scientific study that they rely on.\" They... probably won't work. \"You can only maximize your size to what you\u2019re capable of achieving,\" Dr. Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The New Naked, tells BuzzFeed Life. We\u2019re not pointing any fingers here, but apparently lots of people are turning to Google with questions about penis sizes. And if you're worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyone's preferences are different. Many women don't even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people don't care very much about size or length. The size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner's ability to experience pleasure. Obviously erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra and Cialis are the most common. While they won\u2019t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis. So if you\u2019re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length. Talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription. This is not a trap. When you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach, it could make your penis seem smaller. \"If you lose weight, you can actually gain an inch or two because the [pubic] fat would be less,\" says Fisch. First of all, if you're feeling ill-equipped after watching porn \u2014 stop comparing your goods to a porn star's. The average erect penis is 5.4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says Fisch. Chances are, you're actually pretty close to average. ALL THAT BEING SAID, you really shouldn\u2019t worry so much about your size anyway. Seriously. Sure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference. But you\u2019ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don\u2019t care either way. It\u2019s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner \u2014 and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on. It's 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all). First, let's talk about all those creams, pills, treatments, and surgeries that promise to give you a way longer, stronger boner. At BuzzFeed Health, we're all about helping you achieve your goals. So we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this. Then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity... because, it might not be. And OK, yes, there are some pills you can take. So if you've noticed a little extra weight around that area, losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to. If you're not sure where to start, check out our Clean Eating Challenge and our 28-Day Get Fit Challenge for some inspiration. It's worth noting here that if you're having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just aren't what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease. Definitely talk to your doctor if you're experiencing problems like this. Don't just borrow a few pills from your friend's Viagra Rx. Just, you know, in case you're wondering. Supplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow \u2014 both of which can lead to stronger boners, says Fisch."}
{"pred": "I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do. When I look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that I must vote for Donald Trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the United States of America. Some of my Christian friends tell me they can\u2019t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between \"the lesser of two evils,\" the morally right thing is to choose neither one. They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate. As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice. In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump. \"But my conscience won\u2019t let me vote for Donald Trump,\" some have told me. But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency. A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things. I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors\u2019 conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an \"evil candidate.\" I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws. To my friends who tell me they won\u2019t vote for Trump because there is a chance he won\u2019t govern at all like he promises, I reply that all of American presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen. If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency? Consider instead the most likely results. The most likely result of voting for Trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation. In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do. That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote. I am writing this article because I doubt that many \"I can\u2019t vote for Trump\" Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency. By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will \"seek the welfare\" of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation? But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton\u2019s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation\u2019s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny. These incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal Supreme Court resulting from Hillary Clinton\u2019s election, Christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. Step-by-step, Christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. Is withholding a vote from Donald Trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom? On the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic \u2013 I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him \"a good candidate with flaws\" is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation. In addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that I call \"reductionism\" \u2013 the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered. In this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a Clinton or a Trump presidency. A good candidate with flaws Some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem: \"On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.\" (Obadiah 1:11). Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James: \"Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin\" (James 4:17). \"But Trump has changed his mind in the past,\" a politically-minded friend said to me. \"How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he\u2019ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice.\" My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said. Two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention. He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. And he said: However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election. While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation. These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. They realize that Trump didn\u2019t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock. \"But are you saying that character doesn\u2019t matter?\" someone might ask. I believe that character does matter, but I think Trump\u2019s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent\u2019s character. Trump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket. In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama\u2019s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. Many can\u2019t even find jobs, and others can\u2019t find full-time jobs. Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers. And notice how Trump has changed his mind. He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. We should applaud these changes. In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians. It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as \"family policy councils\" in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty. Freedom for Christian influence in politics How can we know that Trump won\u2019t change his mind? He is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don\u2019t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election. Trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls\u2019 bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans. But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies. Seek the good of the nation His choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress. He is a committed evangelical Christian. He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana. Significantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech. Trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them. Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it\u2019s 45%. Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump\u2019s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth. If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good. Trump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation\u2019s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced \"Cadillac\" insurance plans. But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry. Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom. It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states. That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another. Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost \u2013 not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage. With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools. A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator. The Supreme Court with Trump as president They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say \"Merry Christmas,\" or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists. They\u2019re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech. They have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands. By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers\u2019 unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth. \"Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed . . . . This administration has failed America\u2019s inner cities. It\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed and on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime . . . . Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? . . . . We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\" American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other \u2013 because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion. Trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court. A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a \"dream list\" of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the \"original meaning\" view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death. Trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. If Clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many Christian business owners will be targeted. Hobby Lobby won its 2014 Supreme Court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, are still on the court). If that case is overturned, it would force Hobby Lobby out of business, because the Green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. The implications for other Christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous. Mozilla/Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda. Trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls \"the unprotected\" in America -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. Trump said in his acceptance speech, \"Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . . . I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.\" Trump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration\u2019s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel. Religious liberty Religious liberty Abortion Abortion Trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters. Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time. It wouldn\u2019t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended. On abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute \"right to abortion\" in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions. Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court. Some Christians have even hinted to me that \"persecution would be good for us.\" But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" (Matthew 6:13). Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life: Should Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are \"exiles\" on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah\u2019s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon: The Supreme Court with Clinton as president The current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views. So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations. Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections. Hillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them. Trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS. Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive. A liberal Supreme Court would also impact education. Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of \"discrimination\" if they required adherence to the Bible\u2019s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs. Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v. Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. And now California\u2019s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student\u2019s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations. So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. Millions of unborn children would continue to die. But that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph. \"At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. . . . . there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State . . . . If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.\" (italics added) \"I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.\" (1Timothy 2:1) Trump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton\u2019s support when she was secretary of state. If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won\u2019t be bullied. Christian schools and colleges Does character matter? Taxes and jobs Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? The three conservative justices still on the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns just last month. The case concerned a Washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the Stormans family, who are committed Christians. They will likely now be put out of business by the Washington State Pharmacy Board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear the Stormans\u2019 appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by Justice Alito (joined by Roberts and Thomas): Freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed \"in Jesus\u2019 name\" when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v. Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court. Christian business owners \"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare\" (Jeremiah 29:7). Such a court would likely overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states. A conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches. Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible\u2019s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs. In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda. Criminalizing dissent Freedom of speech Another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists\u2019 claims about the danger of man-made global warming. Minorities ISIS and terrorism Executive orders and bathrooms Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action \"must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion\" (note: not a specific denomination but \"religion\" in general). A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination. Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench. Churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court. The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. (This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools.) And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their \"gender identity\" if the churches are going to be open to the public at all. The unprotected Health care Energy Israel Borders China and Russia The military The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.

{"pred": "Warren Buffett: Ben Bernanke Should Stay On As Fed Chair That appears to be Warren Buffett's philosophy when it comes to who should be the next head of the Federal Reserve -- he'd rather have current Chairman Ben Bernanke remain in the position. Buffett also endorsed Bernanke back in 2009, in the heat of the crisis, calling him \"the ideal person to be running the Fed.\" The Fed Chairman himself, however, likely won't be talked into the idea of holding onto the position. Obama revealed in June that Bernanke had \"already stayed a lot longer than he wanted.\" The billionaire investor and philanthropist appeared on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" Thursday to weigh in on the debate over who'll be President Barack Obama's pick to succeed Bernanke when his term expires next year. Current Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen is the current White House front-runner, after economist Larry Summers dropped out last Sunday. But Buffett, as it turns out, is all for Bernanke. Buffett's comments echo similar ones he made last October when he said he'd \"get my kids out and everybody else to vote for [Bernanke]\" for another term. \"When you have a .400 hitter in the lineup you don't take him out,\" Buffett said. \"He may want to leave, but I think he's done -- since the panic of five years ago -- I think he's done a terrific job.

{"pred": "You\u2019ll Never Guess What Else Gives You The Munchies Do you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived? Let us know your thoughts on our social media or in the comments section below. Until now you thought that your love for marijuana was the reason for your munchies, but you\u2019ll never guess what else can actually give you the munchies. According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation. After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening. Finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body\u2019s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite. Just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint. Endocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\" The endocannabinoid system So it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. This means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it. The scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food. Sleep deprivation and obesity It has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere\u2019s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety. The University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm. Conducting the study"}

{"pred": "But is it safe to drink blood? In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out. [Circulatory System: Facts, Function & Diseases] The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be \u2014 such as the heart, vessels, and so on \u2014 it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. [7 Strange Ways that People Act Like Vampires] Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: \"No vampire I\u2019ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,\" Browning said, according to BBC. You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us. If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy \u2014 for you, not your victim. Turns out, sucking blood isn't just fiction fun: In 2011, a 19-year-old Texas man named Lyle Bensley allegedly broke into a woman's apartment and bit her on the neck. This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault. Because blood is so rich in iron \u2014 and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron \u2014 any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders. Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book \"The Science of Vampires\" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, \"requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.\" With such a high interest in vampires these days \u2014 they're all over television, movies, and bookstore shelves \u2014 many people may be wondering if humans really can survive as vampires.

A lot of people give millennials flack (*cough cough, Baby Boomers!*) but this new study shows that millennial couples are actually much better at a certain relationship skill than other generations. The study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships. The survey included 1,902 adults, and included couples of all ages to see how different age groups talked about their money matters. Most of the couples classified themselves as \"married\" or \"committed.\" Millennials were classified as participants who were 18-34 years old. That\u2019s right! We\u2019re good at something! Turns out, according to the second annual TD Bank Love and Money Study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners. Among this group, couples were found to be much happier on average than the other demographics, with 49% of the millennial couples saying that they\u2019re \"extremely happy\" with their \"soulmate.\" Awww! The fact that millennials are good at this feels weirdly like a no-brainer. Though other generations will often disparage millennials for being too sensitive and open about their feelings, it seems like the benefit of this is millennials are more likely to be transparent and not shy away from tough relationship conversations.

Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you\u2019ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine. Months later, I still hadn\u2019t picked up an oar. Instead, I\u2019d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. I felt as if I\u2019d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. Getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task. That seemed curious, but I was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that I ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime \u2014 rowing. It had kept me in shape for years, and I was missing early mornings on the Potomac. Phil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn\u2019t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill. The first hint of trouble came just a week after I had knee replacement surgery. I was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when I realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press. \"How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they\u2019re just aging and can\u2019t do everything they used to \u2014 when they actually have this disease?\" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker. Along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative. When I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age \u2014 73 \u2014 my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control. \"A definitive test does not exist for PMR,\" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. \"And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,\" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer. Such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O\u2019Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on. Fortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease. Most patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects. So the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever. \"There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,\" Manno said. My rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free \u2014 a sign of a cure \u2014 sometime in 2017. Most doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease. \"I thought I\u2019d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,\" he said. \"Grandchildren were saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with Papa?\u2019 \" \"It\u2019s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,\" she said. Never heard of it? Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work. For a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is \"wonderful, wicked\" in Manno\u2019s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as \"moon face.\" Any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment. \"Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,\" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. \"In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.\" Many people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work. Although diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision. Why and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system. Until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides. With the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America\u2019s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR. Actually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose. The rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away. Much of today\u2019s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone."}
{"pred": "World Series: Here\u2019s How the Chicago Cubs Won Game 7 Here\u2019s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7: On Wednesday night the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians, 8-7, in a Game 7 for the ages. With that victory \u2014 yes, the following words are really true \u2014 the Chicago Cubs won the World Series. Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over. The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. No game in the series lasted more than 2:10. But it just couldn\u2019t come easy, couldn\u2019t be won without extra drama. The Cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. But a double and a two-run home run by the Indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning. A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game. It is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one. Then the rain came. Of course. The top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. But once it let up, the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P. Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed. The Indians were not able to match the Cubs\u2019 strong start to the game. Victor Mather: Oct. 14, 1908. Bennett Park, Detroit. Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series. They are nine outs away from doing it again. Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score With one out left in the game, the Indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the Cubs ended a World Series drought that had been going since 1908. With Rajai Davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio visited the mound. Chicago allowed Guyer to advance to second base without a throw and Davis delivered again with a single that drove Guyer in and closed the gap to one run. Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning The Cubs are back in the lead thanks to Ben Zobrist, Miguel Montero, and a couple questional intentional walks. David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks. One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians. The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5. Still a ways to go, though. The meat of the Indians\u2019 order comes up at least two more times. Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top After a brief rain delay, the game resumed with Kyle Schwarber facing off against Bryan Shaw. The Cubs\u2019 designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game. The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners. Top of 9th: Cubs\u2019 Squeeze Doesn\u2019t Work David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845). Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians\u2019 pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup. Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber. They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard. The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller. Top of 10th: Rain Delay, Then Cubs Pounce David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders. Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland\u2019s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series. Victor Mather: Extra-innings Game 7\u2019s: 1924 Senators-Giants, 1991 Twins-Braves, 1997 Marlins- Indians. And tonight. The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs\u2019 batters getting warmed up in this weather. David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs\u2019 Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment. Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. It feels like a game again. David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago\u2019s lead back to 6-3. Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning. Bottom of 1st: Indians Can\u2019t Match Cubs\u2019 Start Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on. Upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days. Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs\u2019 worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs\u2019 fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I. Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn\u2019t quite handle. The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross. Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago\u2019s lead in half. Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting. For the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever. Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester. The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning. The ending was complicated because Aroldis Chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings. With their closer gone, the Cubs called on Carl Edwards Jr., a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out. The 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out Mike Napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball. He got Jose Ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out. That brought up Brandon Guyer, and Edwards walked him on five pitches. Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left. It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches. A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen\u2019s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs. Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game. It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky. David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans. Prior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both. Cleveland brought in Trevor Bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in Games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out Jason Heyward and getting Javier Baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage.The Indians now have three outs to get back into the game. With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches. The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base. Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes. Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell\u2019s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on. Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first. Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago\u2019s bullpen. He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two. But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis. Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks\u2019 ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first. Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop. Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor\u2019s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor\u2019s foot may not have been on the bag. David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall\u2019s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out. Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo\u2019s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross\u2019s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored. Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs. Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning. Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning. Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left\u2013center for a double, bringing in a run. Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning. Bottom of 8th: Tie Game! The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it. A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago\u2019s three-run lead in just two batters. Shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to Addison Russell, and with the bases loaded, Miguel Montero laced a single into left that drove in Chicago\u2019s eighth run of the game. The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth. Theo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs\u2019 top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history\u2019s long reach. Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis. He fired Kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97.4-mph fastball. Francisco Lindor flied out to right, ending the inning. Victor Mather: It\u2019s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it. Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done In Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland\u2019s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June. After Fowler\u2019s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single. Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller. He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller\u2019s \"unhittable\" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right. Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw. Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber\u2019s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace\u2019s night. Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians\u2019 bullpen. This game is headed to extra innings. Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis\u2019s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop. Joe Maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for Michael Montgomery with Michael Martinez due up. The left-hander took care of business, retiring Martinez on a soft groundball and earning himself a save. With first base empty, Shaw intentionally walked Anthony Rizzo to get to Zobrist. The versatile veteran who won a World Series with Kansas City last year made him pay for it by driving in Almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the Cubs. David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up. David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run. It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. Is it meant to be? While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs. Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning. Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning. Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks\u2019s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning. Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs\u2019 better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first. Albert Almora came in as a pinch-runner for Schwarber and the move paid off when Kris Bryant hit a deep flyout to center and Almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second. Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play. But with that that, Miller\u2019s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team\u2019s closer, Cody Allen. Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play. The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat. David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up. Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity. Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber\u2019s Night Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play. David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench. Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for. But 2016 was the 108th year after their last title, and a baseball is sewn together with 108 stitches. This had to be the year. David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it\u2019s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even. That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez.

{"pred": "Let\u2019s get this out of the way: Poke\u0301mon Go is meant for walking. But where I live, it\u2019s also upwards of 100 degrees outside right now. And besides, walking? This is America; that\u2019s for suckers. But for those tempted to play the game while driving, it\u2019s proven extremely dangerous. We\u2019ve seen driving players hit trees, and at least two have even hit cop cars\u2014one in Baltimore and another in Montre\u0301al. Fortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting Poke\u0301mon. Once you have your next Poke\u0301stop determined, plug your phone in, throw it on silent, and forget about it until your next stop. Then you\u2019ll pull up with a fully recharged phone with more than enough battery life to stuff your next gym full of Magikarp. I tried catching Poke\u0301mon while parked in a drive-thru. Even then, I felt dumb when I didn\u2019t move up immediately because there was a Poliwag in sight. Park somewhere where you\u2019ll stay parked to catch Poke\u0301mon. The great thing about the Poke\u0301mon Go interface is that it gives you a map. You can tap on further away gyms and Poke\u0301stops to see where they are before they\u2019re in range, and thus, you can figure out where you\u2019d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving. The little suckers move around in AR mode, too! It\u2019s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy Poke\u0301mon. It\u2019s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. You can\u2019t easily spin around in the driver\u2019s seat if a Poke\u0301mon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway. Rather, do what the game wants you to do: get out and explore. See your city\u2019s landmarks. If you have an egg to hatch, drive to a park that has a few stops in it. Poke\u0301mon Go requires your full attention. Driving also requires your full attention. Yes, there\u2019s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that AR feature on to put Poke\u0301mon on a backdrop of whatever\u2019s in front of you. Problem is, you\u2019re then focusing on catching the Poke\u0301mon instead of the background of reality. I will say that my fear of becoming That Guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing Poke\u0301mon Go has made me a less distracted driver. With the game on, gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights. I simply don\u2019t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel. Find a few points of interest, write them down, or put them in your car\u2019s navigation unit. Then drive there! Driving is great. When you park, do so in a safe and legal location. Be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would. Once you\u2019re at a stop and have caught all the new Poke\u0301mon you can, you can start the process all over again: pick a new Poke\u0301stop or gym to drive to based on the options available, toss your silent phone on a charger out of reach, and have at it. So, keep it in park if you\u2019re going to do anything in the game. You can enjoy the comfortable seats, luxurious cupholders and life-sustaining air conditioning of your car\u2019s interior, but don\u2019t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked, and out of the way of other traffic. So, if you must catch \u2018em all in a car, there are some things that can be done to mitigate the risk of crashing into police, being charged with vehicular manslaughter or just being bad at the game. Here are some rules to follow. It\u2019s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don\u2019t expect it to hatch eggs much faster. There are better ways to cheat this, after all, some of which even involve the use of remote-control cars. I\u2019m always looking for shortcuts. So, naturally, the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands\u2014or laps on a race track\u2014to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan. Pick Poke\u0301stops that coincide with other errands you have to do. My usual coffee shop, for example, is next door to a gym. That\u2019s convenient! I\u2019m out of my car anyway and it\u2019s a place I don\u2019t mind hanging out for a little while. If you\u2019re playing around cars, make sure they\u2019re going to stay parked for a while. Inside Petrol Lounge, Austin. One of many landmarks you\u2019ll find as Poke\u0301stops in the game. One big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work, or to log those brief moments where you\u2019re traveling at low speeds (more on this later). This will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who\u2019s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes. http://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla... http://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla... If you\u2019re the kind of person who is tempted by phone sounds, hide it in a cubbyhole. Out of sight, out of mind. If you know you\u2019ll still somehow hear it vibrate, turn off that function as well. If you really have no self-control, stick your phone in the trunk. Turns out, there\u2019s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled. While I couldn\u2019t find the limit published on any official channels, one unofficial source on Quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph\u2014which sounds about right. Rule No. 2: Scope Out Your Next Poke\u0301stop Before Going There Simply put: \"P\" means \"play.\" Or, if you have a manual transmission, don\u2019t even think about playing until you\u2019ve yanked the parking brake. Nope. The app was one step ahead of that idea. After my roughly 48-kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching, I wondered what was up. How to leave your phone hidden while charging, as illustrated in a Porsche 918 Spyder. Rule No. 4: Get Out And Walk Around Anyway Rule No. 3: Leave Your Phone On, But On Silent And Hidden Parked to figure out my next move. Because you have to drive safely, we don\u2019t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads. That\u2019s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. 12! You would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road.

Unfortunately, the choice to give an animal as a surprise present during the silly season can sometimes be a shotgun decision...and the gift isn\u2019t always so well received. If you want to buy someone a pet this Christmas (fluffy, feathered or in between) make sure you have a conversation with your loved one first. This ensures that you have all the facts beforehand, and you can take the journey together from the very first step. Spread some Christmas cheer around. You can get started by creating a fundraising page or donating to your local RSPCA or shelter this holiday break. Make a Contribution: Buying a pet as for someone you care about is a wonderful idea over the holidays. It gives them a lifetime of companionship, and it gives a pet the chance to go to a loving home. The RSPCA is annually inundated with unwanted gifted pets from Boxing Day onwards. Numbers at shelters also swell with older animals being dumped as owners are unable to find alternate homes or kennels over the holidays. Why not consider adopting a pet from your local RSPCA or animal shelter? These animals are so eager to love and you can feel great knowing you have saved them from an uncertain future. As a result, many people will take their pet to the RSPCA or local animal shelter to surrender it. In recent years, the statistics stand at three pets being abandoned every hour over the Christmas period. Take Action: Bringing a new life into someone else\u2019s is a huge commitment, and it needs to be a decision that is made by all people involved. Some people simply do not have the means to keep a pet, the time to train them...or unfortunately they are genuinely not wanted at all. If adopting isn\u2019t ideal for you, fostering a pet is also a great way to make a difference by providing a homeless pet with a loving environment until they are able to be adopted out. The statistics are tragic as often the animals will have to be put down. If this article has inspired you to make a difference, there\u2019s a number of things you can do to help out!"}

That's because Scarlett Johansson -- who co-stars with Joaquin Phoenix in the film, but doesn't appear onscreen -- gives such a remarkable performance that she could wind up with an historic Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Scarlett is eligible, deserves the recognition, and we are going to campaign for her \u2014 Megan Ellison (@meganeellison) October 13, 2013 With regard to Johansson's Oscar bona fides, the issue becomes slightly tricky. As Deadline.com's Pete Hammond pointed out, non-traditional \"flesh-and-blood\" acting roles -- like Andy Serkis, who did revolutionary motion-capture work as Gollum in the \"Lord of the Rings\" films -- are normally ignored by Academy Awards voters. Johansson's performance appears somewhat different, however, as she's not helped by any technical tricks or animation. For what it's worth, Warner Bros. and \"Her\" producer Megan Ellison are planning a full-court press for Johansson's awards campaign. Ellison tweeted this in response to Hammond's post on Sunday: \"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. It's incredibly appealing,\" echoed HitFix critic Drew McWeeny. (HuffPost Entertainment was in the tank for Johansson as well.) \"It's Johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: She creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas. \"Her\" is out in theaters on Dec. 18. More on the film can be found here. Jonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out Johansson's voice work as exceptional.

{"pred": "More recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European. Every blue-eyed person on the planet is descended from a single European who lived around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, and who first developed a specific mutation that accounts for the now widespread iris coloration. The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. To date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern Spain. Naturally, the eyes had long since decayed, however genetic analysis revealed that they would have appeared blue in color. Originally, all humans had brown eyes, although genetic variation relating to a gene called OCA2 resulted in changes to the amount of pigment produced by different individuals, resulting in the emergence of different shades of brown. Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success."}

{"pred": "5 Reasons The Seventh Inning Stretch Is One Of Baseball's Most Fascinating Traditions There are several competing theories as to why, in the middle of the seventh inning, every baseball game comes to a stop so everyone can stretch, sing a really old song and take a breather. But for more than a century, the seventh inning stretch has been one of baseball's most cherished moments, exemplifying the humor, sportsmanship and love of tradition that make the sport unique. Here are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment. Another theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing \"the stretch\" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). Other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof. Relive The Longest Game In Baseball History: THE TRADITION The origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit. \"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history,\" Tony La Russa, the three-time World Series-winning manager, told The Huffington Post. La Russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game's roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay. Dave Ferguson, a baseball enthusiast and the radio host of \"Beyond the Cheers,\" believes that no matter which origin story you prefer, the seventh inning stretch remains as integral to the game as anything. Baseball is physically and mentally grueling. The lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. The 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. During the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies. President William Howard Taft throws out the first ball to open a baseball season in history in Washington in April of 1910. (Photo by Mark Rucker/Transcendental Graphics, Getty Images) \"It's actually taken on its own life, depending on the team,\" Ferguson told HuffPost. \"The players look at it as a break from the game itself. And it's appreciated by the fans.\" And the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. According to MLB.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. During the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes. This past season, the average game time tied the all-time high of two hours, 58 minutes. And during those nearly three hours, actual baseball happens for only 18 minutes -- including balls in play and wild pitches -- according to a study by The Wall Street Journal. Tony La Russa: \"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history.\" (AP) THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS Aside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films. Ichiro Suzuki, the New York Yankees outfielder and future Hall of Famer, told The Huffington Post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties.

{"pred": "Whether you think rice is a friend or foe to your diet, there's one thing we can all agree on: It's delicious. (If you don't agree, I'm sorry, but I don't understand you.) Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool\u2014they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more. Bonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found. The researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch\u2014one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body. This is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body. New research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent. No word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out. For now, we'll just continue to sing the praises of coconut oil as we dig in to a bowl of rice totally guilt-free. Like I said: Seriously cool."}

It may be annoying sometimes, but when your cat follows you absolutely everywhere from room to room, it\u2019s just a sign that they like you and want to be where you are. 2. Sure, it\u2019s kind of gross when cats bring dead animals into the house, but they do it because they consider you family \u2013 and they\u2019re trying to teach you how to catch your own prey. Cats aren\u2019t quite as expressive as dogs when it comes to letting their owners know how they feel about them. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love you. 5. Like most creatures, cats don\u2019t like to make themselves vulnerable. So if they roll over and present their belly to you, it\u2019s a sign of unwavering trust. See? Cats aren\u2019t really evil. They\u2019re just kind of shy, awkward, and mysterious when it comes to expressing affection. Just like I was in high school. 4. A cat\u2019s unending stare can be a little bit disconcerting, but don\u2019t fret. First of all, they\u2019re not really staring. Their eyes are evolved to blink less frequently than ours. But more than that, a steady, soft gaze means that they feel safe and comfortable with you. The truth is that cats feel just as much affection for their humans as their canine counterparts. They just say \"I love you\" a little differently... and often in the strangest ways possible. 6. Your cat\u2019s tail is a strong indicator of their mood. The higher they carry it, the more content and happy they are. And if they\u2019re feeling really affectionate, they\u2019ll wrap it around you. 7. Cats nip and nibble at us all the time, but it\u2019s far from an aggressive gesture. Cats do the same when they\u2019re grooming their kittens, so it\u2019s much more likely that they think of you with the same affection. 3. When cats rub their head against you, they\u2019re marking you as one of their own with the concentrated scent glands in their cheeks and head. Congratulations, you\u2019re family. 8. Much like with head-butting, cats will run between your legs to mark you with their scent. 9. If you can get your cat purring, it means that they\u2019re very happy with you and with what you\u2019re doing."}

Because we are travel obsessed, we decided to take a look at how the other half   actually, the top 1% of the 1%   spends their vacation time. Women In The Forbes Top 20 With a growing portfolio of luxurious vacation homes across the U.S., you could say TV's top judge (real name, Judith Sheimdlin) has another career: real-estate mogul. Her new $8.9 million mansion in Naples, Florida mansion is more like a resort, with multiple bedrooms, a lagoon and three waterfalls, no less. She also owns a nine-bedroom manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut; a five-bedroom condo at the luxe Montage Beverly Hills hotel; and an $8.5 million duplex penthouse in Manhattan. It's hard to imagine she has any free time with so many residences, but Judge Judy has also been known to strut her stuff in spots like the Exumas, a chain of islands in the Bahamas. Record sales have paid off for another singer   Barbra Streisand, who ranks number 19 on the Forbes list, with an impressive $370 million fortune. Her escape of choice: a clifftop oceanfront compound in the California beach town of Malibu, where Barbra has her own personal shopping arcade that includes stores where she can display her collections of antiques. The singer and her husband James Brolin also like to escape to places like the Spanish island of Mallorca and St. Tropez on the French Riviera. Funny lady Ellen Degeneres is an avid traveler, vacationing with Portia De Rossi in the French-Caribbean island of St. Bart's; hitting the Dalmatian island of Hvar in Croatia and exploring the Adriatic on a yacht; going on safari in South Africa; and jetting off to the dreamy Tahitian island of Bora Bora. But when she really wants to escape, Degeneres and De Rossi head to their $26.5 million dollar manse in Montecito, California with nine fireplaces and ocean views. Constant touring keeps Katy Perry on the go, but she also manages to squeeze in vacations to places like the Italian island of Sardinia, where she and boyfriend Orlando Bloom made headlines this summer (the couple have also been to Hawaii and France). Another summer favorite: the Greek islands, which was a staple on Perry's Instagram feed. Angelina Jolie: net worth $100 million Madonna walks along a street in Havana.

She's also owned hideaways in the Garden District of New Orleans; on Lake Austin in Austin, Texas; in New York City's SoHo; and in Los Angeles.

Rumor has it that Steele has so many parties that she bought 25 parking spots in the neighborhood to accommodate all her friends' cars. Red-hot romance novelist Nora Roberts writes five or more books a year that really rake it in. Ireland is one of her favorite retreats, naturally: A number of her books are set there. Roberts has also helped turn her hometown of Boonsboro, Maryland   a rural village near Antietam   into a vacation destination in its own right. She owns two restaurants, a bookstore in a pre-Civil War building called Turn the Page, a gift shop and Inn BoonsBoro, a hotel with rooms named for literary couples like Jane and Rochester from Jane Eyre.

{"pred": "This U.S. City Is Welcoming Veterans With An Innovative New Program Those Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families. The program has the enthusiastic backing of the U.S. Army, but it does not take a dime from the government. It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. And it has already racked up some impressive numbers. But unemployment among young, post-9/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers. Now Johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way. He volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called Arts and Healing. The group uses art to help veterans cope with PTSD. Given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate. The Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New Initiative \"Veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision. When I was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs,\" Robinson said. \"The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable.\" Herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the United States as comprehensive as Where Opportunity Knox. In addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of \"regional veteran connectors\" -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs. The latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues. Fred Johnson Fred Johnson volunteers with Healing and the Arts to help younger veterans cope with PTSD. Army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region\u2019s businesses tick, Herd and Pickett insist. The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they\u2019re healthy, they stay out of trouble. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program I tell them, 'Follow your heart, not the money.' You can actually see the community change. Fred Johnson, Army veteran and director of workplace giving, Fund for the Arts \"The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they\u2019re healthy, they stay out of trouble,\" Herd said. \"So we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society.\" Where Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster.com. In 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. For post-9/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. (The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.) Pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army\u2019s training center in California. There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas. Where Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017. The reasons are complicated. The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers\u2019 stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects. After a 29-year career in the Army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he loves. But Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program. I\u2019m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program Johnson, the Army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life. Like many veterans, Johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the Army. The transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col. Walter Herd, the director of the Army\u2019s Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world. Connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army\u2019s work. Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site. And prove himself Johnson has. Local magazine Business First recently named him one of Louisville\u2019s top 20 veterans in business. The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable. Kathy Robinson, founder, Turning Point The Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with \"everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a re\u0301sume\u0301 and job preparation.\" Kathy Robinson, founder of TurningPoint, a Boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work. \"The Army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get \u2018em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation,\" Herd said. \"The preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece. I\u2019m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community.\" There are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military\u2019s separation from civilian society. The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today\u2019s economy. To Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn\u2019t they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS? Soldiers then learn concrete skills in the Army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science. For one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the Army in the first place. It is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation. \"The vast majority of people in the Army -- unless you don\u2019t do your work, who cares? Same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority,\" Johnson added. \"The west side [of Louisville] is very poor and racially diverse. I fit in as well there as at Humana or Brown-Forman where everybody is wearing suits.\" They told him about an opening at Fund for the Arts, a Louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in Louisville\u2019s underprivileged schools. Johnson is now the organization\u2019s director of workplace giving. But more valuable than the skills the Army teaches soldiers are the \"attributes\" that service instills, Herd said. Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox\u2019s walls to return to the civilian world. Where Opportunity Knox helped give Johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the Army had prepared him well for a civilian career. He explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it. \"When we attacked that city it was like a wasteland,\" Johnson said. \"Then we helped rebuild the city. We are trying to do that here in Louisville. On the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of Baquba.\" Until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville. Daniel Marans Retired Col. Walter Herd is director of the Army's Transition Assistance Program. \"You Can Actually See The Community Change.\" Visions of America/Getty Images The Louisville, Kentucky, skyline. Herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world. \"I had a certain idea in mind for what I wanted to do and they helped me work through that,\" Johnson said. \"They helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process. I knew what I wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense.\" Last year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service. Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world. So in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that. But Johnson said he was also fortunate that Fund for the Arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"What was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn\u2019t happen somewhere else,\" Pickett said. Translating \"Army-Speak\" To \"Corporate-Speak\" \"As economic developers, workforce is a challenge,\" said Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant and co-founder of Where Opportunity Knox. \"We have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we\u2019ve gotten past the recession, we\u2019re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills.\" \"I tell them, \u2018Follow your heart, not the money,\" Johnson said. \"You can actually see the community change.\" In fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp. Herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than Army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers. The feeling is mutual. For Kentucky\u2019s business community, Where Opportunity Knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking. \"I wish every American could go through there,\" Pickett said. \"I was just inspired by it.\" The population of the greater Louisville area has grown 2.8 percent since 2010 -- in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the Great Recession. \"I told [Fund for the Arts CEO] Christen Boone, this is what [my PTSD] means and this is what I am doing to overcome it,\" Johnson said. \"I said I am bringing more positive baggage than negative. She took a chance on me. I wish more CEOs and executives had the courage.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to the greater Louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy. The city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector. Louisville proper is home to UPS\u2019 Worldport air hub, as well as two Ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant Humana. And while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think Maker\u2019s Mark, Woodford Reserve and Evan Williams -- it is also the base of Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Through his work at Fund for the Arts, Johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of Louisville. He compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the Iraqi city of Baquba after the Army brigade he led helped conquer it. I can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me I must visit Louisville. \"You\u2019ve gotta come, dude -- it\u2019s awesome,\" Johnson told me. \"This is an up-and-coming town.\" And those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators. In addition to the Army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, Johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds. Both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work. Unemployment in the Louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11.9 percent in February 2010 to 4 percent today. That is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent today. Given Johnson\u2019s worries about the applicability of his Army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description. Daniel Marans Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded Where Opportunity Knox. Filling A Void \"A lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they\u2019ve learned,\" he observed. \"They are 21 years old -- I say, \u2018No, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span. You just don\u2019t realize how many tools you have.\u2019\" That was before he met with the folks at Where Opportunity Knox. Fred Johnson is effusive."}

Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run. \"Judge\u2019s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst. Judge\u2019s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers.

Aaron Judge's blasts go a long way Starlin Castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as Judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take BP. He remembers being around Stanton in the Arizona Fall League in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, Castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now. Mark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic. In 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far. BOSTON -- When Aaron Judge was last a normal-sized human being, at about 9 or 10 years old, the player who made him run to his television was Barry Bonds. Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park. Holliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest. Matt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there'd be an exam afterward. It's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge\u2019s power. It's early, but Judge has joined Stanton as a player you can\u2019t miss. His power, like Bonds in his prime, makes it nearly impossible to look away. He's the type of player little kids will be running to their televisions to see. On Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League."}

For comparison, the most expensive cost of living in the world is Hamilton, Bermuda, with an index of 141.59, 10 points higher than the second-most expensive city on the list, Geneva, Switzerland. Seven of the top 10 cities on the list are in Switzerland. That\u2019s according to rankings published by data company Numbeo. The company continuously updates its data and just published its Cost of Living Index Rate for 2017. The list is calculated relative to New York City, which has an index of 100. If a city has a cost of living index of 130, it is 30 percent more expensive than New York; if a city has an index of 70, it is 30 percent less expensive. In fact, 16 of the 20 least expensive cities on the list are in the vast South Asian nation. Since the country is so large, it\u2019s able to produce the majority of its goods domestically, without having to import more expensive products from other countries.

{"pred": "If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate. However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. Using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. Several other foods \u2013 all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both \u2013 were tightly bunched behind. At the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. Even water ranked higher than these. The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist. Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs. To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors. \"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write. We all know it is not easy to avoid the unhealthy stuff, but which food is hardest of all? Iulian Valentin/Shutterstock The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected. \"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE Strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. A match-up between caffeine and pizza\u2019s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time. Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries."}

That last detail is especially important for retirees who haven't saved as much as they had hoped. Fortunately, there are a number of countries where you can retire comfortably with a smaller nest egg. Living on the cheap is even easier when you're receiving Social Security benefits. As of 2016, the retirement plan, that, along with your Social Security payments, should be enough to last three decades in the following eight international locales. 2. Nicaragua \u00a9 Tan Yilmaz/Getty Images Nicaragua is located in the heart of Central America, and it's a premier retirement destination if you're looking for an excellent quality of life without a high price tag. The Nicaraguan government offers a number of financial incentives to attract foreign retirees, such as a sales tax exemption on construction materials if you're building a home. You need to be at least 45 years old and have a minimum monthly income of $600 to qualify, which may be appealing if you're considering an early retirement. It's one of The 7 Best Countries for Retiring in Latin America . 4. Belize \u00a9 Kelley Miller/National Geographic RF/Getty Images Palm trees, blue skies and sandy beaches are some of the best reasons to retire in Belize, as is the fact that it's extremely budget-friendly. Housing in Belize City is dirt cheap, with a 900-square-foot furnished rental going for as little as $377 a month. The Qualified Retired Persons Incentive Program makes it even more attractive for retirees age 45 and up since any income earned from sources outside Belize is 100% tax-free. 5. Panama \u00a9 Susan Leggett/Alamy Panama proves to be exceptionally welcoming for retirees from all parts of the globe who come in search of a tropical atmosphere. Prices in Panama City tend to be on par with what you'd pay in the U.S., but you'll find that the surrounding smaller towns and villages are much more affordable. The Pensionado Program saves foreign retirees some extra cash by offering discounts on flights, hospital services, utilities and more. 7. Malaysia \u00a9 Richard I'Anson/Getty Images Malaysia's people are just as warm as the weather, and this is the kind of place where outsiders are easily welcomed into the fold. As far as the cost of living goes, Malaysia is roughly 44% cheaper than the U.S. Housing is an especially good deal, with rent prices that are 69% lower than what you'd find here at home. Retirees can apply for a long-term visa through the Malaysia My Second Home Program. If you're 50 or older, you'll need at least 350,000 Malaysian ringgits ($89,343 USD) in assets and 10,000 Malaysian ringgits ($2,552 USD) in monthly income. 1. Ecuador \u00a9 Gabrielle & Michel Therin-Weise/Getty Images Expatriates flock to Ecuador because of its gorgeous landscape, superior healthcare system and the generous government benefits extended to retirees, including discounts on utilities and public transportation. Housing is a steal in the capital city of Quito, with the monthly rent for a furnished, 900-square-foot apartment start at just $538. Utilities run $53 a month on average. Overall, Ecuador has a cost of living that's 58% cheaper than New York City. 6. Costa Rica \u00a9 billberryphotography/Getty Images Costa Rica is popular with tourists, but certain areas, such as the Central Valley region and the southern coast, are ideally suited for establishing permanent residence on a shoestring. Even if you decide to set up shop in the capital city of San Jose, rental prices can go as low as $417 per month or up to $1,042, depending on the neighborhood. Utilities typically run between $48 and $79 per month, so it's definitely possible to make your retirement savings stretch. 3.

{"pred": "The Terrifying Way Not Sleeping Enough Actually Changes Your Gut This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained.  Experts still don\u2019t fully understand why not getting enough sleep is connected to all of these conditions, but new research published this month adds one piece to the puzzle: Not getting enough sleep may cause changes to gut bacteria that could fundamentally change our metabolism, affecting a host of bodily systems. Additional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. But the new data makes a strong case, Cedernaes said \u2015 a strong case for catching your Zs. The data showed that getting less sleep didn\u2019t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had. But getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria. The amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent \u2015 and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep. Sleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, Cedernaes said. And while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes.  Studies link insufficient sleep to some pretty scary consequences, including an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and even some cancers. What\u2019s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night\u2019s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases. The study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals. Plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone\u2019s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level. Gut microbiota are the trillions of microorganisms living in our intestines that help keep our metabolism, immune system and other bodily functions running normally, explained senior study author Jonathan Cedernaes, a sleep researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden. Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. \"Gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies,\" Cedernaes said. \"[They] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise. They can also help us extract nutrients.\"  The finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, Cedernaes explained.  There was yet another interesting finding from the study. The individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep \u2015 a potential diabetes risk \u2015 compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer.  The researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours."}
{"pred": "Here\u2019s a look at nine ways the \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake differed from the original: Well, that\u2019s still up for interpretation, but one thing is clear: There were many plot twists and updates that gave the newly released \"Beauty and Beast\" a completely different feel from the original. As everyone returned to work Monday morning, it\u2019s safe to assume rooms were buzzing with discussions about the highly anticipated \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake that debuted over the weekend. It\u2019s true. Lyrics to one of the movie\u2019s most popular songs, \"Gaston,\" sounded a little different than the original. While they were new to moviegoers, \"Beauty and the Beast\" composer Alan Menken said they weren\u2019t technically \"new\" -- they were simply unused lyrics by the late Howard Ashman that didn\u2019t make the cut in the original film. The live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake made history by featuring Disney\u2019s first-ever \"exclusively gay moment.\" In the new film, Josh Gad\u2019s character, LeFou -- Gaston\u2019s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version. Unlike in the original, the new Beast is highly educated, boasting about his expensive education while quoting Shakespeare and critiquing Belle\u2019s admiration for \"Romeo and Juliet.\" The Beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn\u2019t always that way. In the 1991 animated movie, the audience assumes the Beast was born like that, his attitude simply accompanying the crown. In the remake, we found out that\u2019s not entirely the case. But thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. With a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the Beast (Dan Stevens) and Belle travel back in time to Paris, where Belle was born. The pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. It\u2019s \"much smaller\" than Belle imagined. It\u2019s here the Beast tells Belle what happened to her mother. This is a sharp contrast from the original movie, where a bored and seemingly illiterate Beast needed Belle\u2019s help sounding out words in the books. The Beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with Belle that his huge library really is wonderful. The Beast doesn\u2019t need any help reading a book, and Belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point. So how did the remake compare to the original? In the 1991 animated movie, the Beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. In the remake, there\u2019s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before \"the last petal falls,\" referring to the enchanted rose. In the remake, Belle (Emma Watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she\u2019s also a teacher and inventor. Questions were answered, characters changed and some key scenes and moments in the film made the remake stand out -- not simply as a copycat but as a film that can stand on its own. And in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the Beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as Belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. At that moment, it appears the curse is final. Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes. Belle take a long pause before finally telling the Beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek. Behind her stands the transforming enchantress, who originally placed the curse on the Beast and his castle. As she overhears Belle\u2019s last cry, she lifts the curse, bringing the Beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves. The enchantress then disappears without a trace.  Some may have been covering their ears, while others thoroughly examined each and every detail -- good or bad -- of the live-action update of the 1991 animated classic. In the original \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the audience simply knows \"crazy Maurice\" (Kevin Kline) as a widower and Belle as his apparent caretaker. It was never clear who Belle\u2019s mother was or what happened to her. While Belle asks Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) and some others why they remain loyal to the Beast, they explain that they failed him when he was a boy. The Beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. Therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never \"protected\" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a \"Beast\" well before his physical transformation. After spotting a doctor\u2019s mask on the floor, the Beast concludes Belle\u2019s mother died from the plague. A flashback between Maurice and Belle\u2019s mom (Zoe Rainey), sick in bed, saying their farewells proves this to be the case. The woman tells Maurice to take Belle away so she doesn\u2019t catch the disease as well. So he does, and the rest is history. It\u2019s clear Belle is one of the only literate women in town. While other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, Belle\u2019s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she\u2019s not ashamed of it. In fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so. When Maurice approaches the path to the Beast\u2019s castle, he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again. Gaston and LeFou exchange glances, implying that Maurice has lost it, and tell him it\u2019s time to turn around. But Maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. Gaston loses his temper with Maurice and says he only entertained Maurice\u2019s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. When Maurice says that will never happen, Gaston realizes Maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves. She held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. Rather than washing the clothes by hand, Belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town. At one point in the film, Gaston asks LeFou why he doesn\u2019t have a lady. LeFou shrugs his shoulders and says he\u2019s \"too clingy.\" At the end of the movie, LeFou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with Belle and the prince. He starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of Gaston\u2019s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup. Not cool, Gaston (Luke Evans). While trying to win the affection of his \"future father-in-law,\" Gaston pretends to believe Maurice\u2019s warning that a strange Beast has taken his daughter, Belle, captive. So he and LeFou (Josh Gad) take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night, asking Maurice to lead the way. \"LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,\" director Bill Condon told Attitude magazine. \"He\u2019s confused about what he wants. It\u2019s somebody who\u2019s just realising that he has these feelings.\" \"[They\u2019re] not actually new lyrics, they\u2019re actually Howard Ashman\u2019s that were outtake things,\" Menken told ComicBook prior to the premiere in Los Angeles. \"We had also put some of the outtake lyrics from Howard in the Broadway show. And the reason that they hadn\u2019t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy.\" For example, the added lyric \"I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver and I shoot in the liver\" was too edgy for an animated film, but for this one, Menken said it was perfect. Warning: This post contains spoilers. What happened to Mrs. Potts\u2019 children, Chip\u2019s brothers and sisters? While Chip (Nathan Mack) has always been front and center, it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn\u2019t alone. In the original film, Mrs. Potts told Chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet. This time around, Chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings. We assume, this time around, he\u2019s Mrs. Potts\u2019 only child. LeFou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving Maurice for dead, pleads with Gaston to reconsider, but Gaston pushes forward and returns to town without Maurice. Little does he know, Maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how Gaston left him there to die. If only they believed him..."}

{"pred": "The researchers wanted to see if a person\u2019s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be \"moral.\" So, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants. In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Ohio State University doctoral student Andrew Luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: They're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. As in: Oh, you disagree with me? Well, I won\u2019t be swayed because I\u2019m standing up for what\u2019s right. Then the researchers tried to change everyone\u2019s mind. They slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution. \"Is moral a magic word?\" he said. \"In some ways, it might be. We grow up thinking morality is this thing that's untouchable. What's moral is permanent and cannot be challenged.\" Simply telling someone their attitude was moral, Luttrull found, gave it more power. Compared to those in the \"tradition\" group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they\u2019d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy. They marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine: The group\u2019s consensus: Recycling is generally a good thing. After respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs. Some heard their views were \"practical.\" Others heard \"moral.\" People's attitudes in the \"morality\" group and \"practicality\" group didn't significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message. But afterward, a post-test revealed the \"moral\" respondents viewed recycling more favorably (7.56 on a nine-point scale) than the \"practical\" respondents (6.88). In the next two experiments \u2014 one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults \u2014 researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling. \"Those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality,\" the authors wrote. Luttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts. Next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed \"feedback\" on their opinions. Some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected \"tradition.\" Others heard their ideas projected \"morality.\" Clinton leads Trump in this ambiguous category, 47 percent to 36 percent, according to the results. The survey, released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, didn't elaborate on what \"moral\" encompasses. \"While your thoughts were similar to other students' on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality/tradition more than the average student.\" A new national poll about how American voters perceive Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton asked: Who between the presidential front-runners has higher moral standards? The takeaway, according to Luttrell: Framing a cause as \"moral\" is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates. Any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why we'll be probably fighting about politics forever. That could help the Democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. According to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality.

{"pred": "TV (THE BOOK): Why \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 was one of TV\u2019s best shows ever Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make. Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world). Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer. You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied. Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success. Included below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place \u2013 alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life \u2013 among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out... It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it. Buffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997\u20132001; UPN, 2001\u20132003) Total score: 94 (Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.) Whedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them. Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy. Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\" In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full. TV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away.

These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer.

{"pred": "The 10 Least Stressful Jobs In 2017 Stress plays a big role in our daily lives, and according to careers website CareerCast, some jobs create more anxiety than others. Last week my colleague Karsten Strauss covered the most stressful jobs, and this week I'm writing about the least stressful. Diagnostic medical sonographer ranked first on CareerCast's list of the least stressful jobs. Photo credit: Shutterstock. CareerCast's stress ratings are averages, and exceptions always arise. For instance, having a difficult manager or extremely demanding clients can make any job unpleasant. Also, much stress is self-induced and best managed by means other than switching jobs, like limiting the number of tasks you take on. But we wanted to publish this list because we think it's informative and thought-provoking. Two years ago, my colleague Susan Adams published many interesting reader responses to an earlier version of this annual list. To see the 10 least stressful jobs and their median salaries, view the gallery below. The second-least stressful job was compliance officer, a role with a median salary of $65,640 that requires making sure your colleagues abide by laws and regulations. A compliance officer at a bank might monitor traders to check if they're following insider trading regulations. CareerCast evaluated 200 professions and rated them on 11 measures of stress, such as the amount of travel required, the growth potential of the industry and job, and the physical demands of the role. The report isn't a survey CareerCast relies largely on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to score every position on each metric, and then rolls that up into an overall stress score. More methodology details are available here. Although these jobs are rated as low-stress based on CareerCast's approach, by no means are they easy or unimportant. Some, such as audiologist and tenured professor, require a Ph.D. Others, like medical and pharmacy technicians, provide critical support in the process of saving lives. Diagnostic medical sonographer was rated as the least stressful job. The position involves using medical imaging equipment like ultrasound machines. Medical sonographers assist physicians in conducting and interpreting these tests, and to become one, you'll need to take an accreditation program that lasts between one and four years. Median pay in 2015 was $63,630. Operations research analyst ranked eighth, with median income of $78,630. Using mathematical and analytical methods, operations analysts help organizations solve complex problems."}

According to research done by psychologist Kevin Dutton called the Great British Psychopath Survey, some jobs seem to attract them and have higher than average numbers of psychopaths among their practitioners. And sorry, business leaders, you're not going to like which gig tops the list: The other end of the scale is also interesting but perhaps offers fewer puzzlers. PsyBlog also offers a list of those jobs least likely to be taken by psychopaths, and, as you'd expect, most are intensely focused on empathizing with or caring for others. These folks aren't necessarily committing crimes, but this small but significant portion of the population does display some essential traits of psychopathy, like lack of empathy, selfishness, lack of guilt, and plenty of charm . And while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions. But, sad to say, those steps are unlikely to be enough. Psychology tells us that psychopaths actually walk among us everyday. Research suggests something like 5 percent of people show psychopathic tendencies Some of these are more surprising than others. Who would have guessed the clergy are prone to psychopathy, for instance? Though, I guess, upon reflection, you could see how a job regarded as especially holy might attract those obsessed with their own importance. And I am, of course, personally shocked to see journalists here. (I look around at colleagues with newly suspicious eyes.) Also, how did politician not make the list? You, like most people, probably want to avoid psychopaths . How do you steer clear?

{"pred": "You may not even be aware that in your garden, you have the most miraculous plant that is the key to curing hair loss, a problem that many people nowadays are facing. According to research the magnificent rosemary is an amazing antioxidant, full of flavonoids which improve the circulation, regulate the thyroid\u2019s work and alleviates headaches. The rosemary has been particularly useful in cosmetics for encouraging hair growth. Take 15 to 20 drops mixed in a glass of water every day. You can also use it externally to treat rheumatism and hair loss. Just massage affected areas and wait for results. If you are suffering from stomach issues or crams, the rosemary will fix them immediately. Studies confirm that this herb positively affects the weight loss process as well, by burning fat effectively. Since it stimulates the circulation so well, the rosemary accentuates the hair growth and prevents dandruff and hair loss. The rosemary is not for oral use nor should it be given to children. Also, pregnant women are advised to consult their doctor before using it. Usually, small amounts in meals and while cooking are allowed. One study, published in 1995 discovered that rosemary can destroy body toxins and act as a genuine diuretic. th century. The rosemary is great for regulating the high blood pressure and for repairing digestive problems. This remedy is also used for numerous other diseases, such as heart problems, and was especially used in wines by Hungarian Queen Isabella in the 14century. Otherwise known as Rosa maris or \"sea rose\" according to the Greeks and romans, this medical herb has been used as a remedy for centuries back. In our culture, this herb is known as rosemary. You can always prepare tea from the rosemary leaves and flowers which will calm the organism and help it relax. Moreover, rosemary can annihilate symptoms of depression and reduce menstrual cramps significantly. Furthermore, rosemary is able to prevent all sorts of inflammation, from bronchitis to ear, nose and throat infections. If you use rosemary externally and combine it with oil, it will relieve symptoms of sciatica, rheumatic pain and muscle soreness. The Queen was 72 years old and was dealing with gout. When she started using the rosemary as a medicine, she discovered immediate results and her skin became so much younger that even the Prince of Poland considered marrying her.

{"pred": "Google: Free music streaming service unveiled Some of the nuts and bolts behind Google's free streaming comes from Google acquisition last year of Songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists. Songza's team will help program the new streaming stations, in contrast to Pandora and Spotify, which are automated. Google's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers. Spotify and Pandora\u2019s streaming services \u2014 both free and paid \u2014 have a big head start on Google. As competition heats up with Apple in the mix, Google will need a free service to pull in paid users. Google doesn\u2019t disclose subscriber numbers. But it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year. Playing catch up to music rivals Spotify and Pandora, Google unveiled a free ad-supported version of its Play Music All Access streaming service Tuesday. Google says that with or without a subscription, users can continue store and play their own purchased music, which includes 50,000 songs, for free. Tuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. Over the weekend, Apple\u2019s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer Taylor Swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period. Apple quickly caved in. But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates. Google, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. As such, the company did not have to negotiate new deals with record labels. But Google is still vulnerable to some of the same challenges other streaming services over its payments to artists and record labels. Users will be able to listen to curated radio stations based on genre, mood, decade or activity. They can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music. In comparison, Spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers. On Google Music, Swift's previous records are available for streaming using the paid service but her most recent album, 1989, is only for sale. The album is not available on paid streaming nor will it be available on the free version. Google\u2019s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. Marketers can buy ads as a part of the Google display and video networks."}
{"pred": "Fat-burning foods already in your kitchen: From chili to mustard, how to turn 8 classic ingredients into bulge-beating superfoods Add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour. Use fresh chilis, chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals. Mustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods, and in particular capsaicin, that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten. 6. MUSTARD 1. CHILI PEPPERS 2. WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES So, reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal. Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells. 5. GARLIC These vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre. As with complex carbohydrates, these will have a thermic effect on the body as more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compounds. 3. BLACK PEPPER Capsaicin, a compound in chilli peppers, stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat. In our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic, producing heat by burning fat. With this in mind, here are eight foods that can have a thermogenic effect on your body: Like ginger, garlic - with its fiery kick - contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost. A 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells. So, aim to reach your seven-a-day, of which five are vegetables and a maximum of two are fruits. Choose fruits with high fibre content, such as apples or pears. 8. PROTEIN It is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables, and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach, rocket, watercress, kale and cabbage. Ginger also contains capsaicin, responsible for its fiery flavour. Eating ginger, fresh or powdered, in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production. 7. GREEN TEA Studies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight. Use it in stir-fries, curries and marinades or try a warming ginger tea. Slice into thick discs and add hot water, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes. Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oats and quinoa (also high in protein), are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down. An effective weight loss programme can be modified to include some of these thermogenic foods to help you to achieve your goals, but it is important to remember that this effect will only be achieved as part of a balanced diet. Wouldn't it be fabulous to be able to eat foods that can help you lose weight, simply by eating them? Although this doesn't quite make sense on first reading, you may be surprised to know that there really are foods that can help you do just that. Always ensure good protein with every meal or snack, not only for its thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full. Vegetarian protein sources include quinoa, beans, brown rice and lentils. 4. GINGER All foods, when consumed, speed up the action of the muscles in the digestive tract, using up energy and producing heat in the process. This is known as thermogenesis. When compared to fats and carbohydrates, eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect. Proteins are complex nutrients and will require more energy to break them down as part of the digestive process. Ginger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced, ready to use in a tea. The extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy, burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods. Therefore, it can promote weight loss, when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity. Research suggests that there are some foods that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism, due to their thermogenic effect on the body - in other words, the amount of energy used and heat produced as your body processes this food. The thermogenic effect of food will depend upon the type of food and the amount of food consumed in the diet as a whole. Studies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols - micronutrients - found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism, boosting the number of calories used by the body. The tricky thing, for many of us, is getting the balance right and ensuring we maintain a healthy weight. However, the metabolism is not always an easy thing to understand and differs from person-to-person, varying in efficiency and requiring differing amounts of energy to process the foods and drinks consumed. However, certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body 'burns' calories. The harder the food is to digest, the more calories the body will have to burn to fully break it down, before it can absorb the nutrients from it. You might be familiar with the notion that eating foods that are high in calories along with a lack of physical activity causes an imbalance in metabolism, which leads to obesity. Research has shown that eating a high protein diet leads to lower weight gain, in part also due to its positive effect on post-meal hunger and desire to eat. Thermogenesis kicks in after every meal and the digestive process continue to burn calories many hours after a meal is eaten. For example, if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calories, around 30 percent (i.e. 100 calories) will be burned during digestion."}

{"pred": "UCLA Has More NCAA Championships Than Black Male Freshmen According to the school's enrollment statistics, African-Americans make up 3.8 percent of the student population. In the video, Stokes points out that black males make up 3.3 percent of the male student population, and that 65 percent of those black males are undergraduate athletes. Of the incoming men in the freshmen class, only 1.9 percent of them were black. The black students at University of California, Los Angeles, sent a strong message about diversity at their school. Namely, the fact that there isn't much when it comes to African-American males, a troubling fact for one of the state's most elite institutions. \"We certainly recognize that the low numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented students on campus does lead to a sense of isolation and invisibility,\" Montero said in her email statement. \"It is difficult to eliminate this painful imbalance without considering race in the admissions process.\" The state of California voted down affirmative action in 1996 and passed Proposition 209, which banned state schools from considering race, gender, ethnicity or national origins in their admissions processes. Black student enrollment has severely decreased since that provision and critics are saying that has to change. The students' video adds to the ongoing affirmative action debate both inside and outside of the state, raising awareness about diversity at institutions around the country. Stokes said he feels responsible for spreading the word about the unknown challenges of being a minority student at UCLA and the ongoing lack of diversity on campus. A group of students, led by Sy Stokes, posted a video voicing their concerns about the number of black students on campus, and their message is hard to ignore. Stokes, a third-year Afro-American studies student who identifies as black, Cherokee and Chinese, recites a spoken word poem in the video, citing blaring statistics about the university's diversity issue. \"Being the cousin of Arthur Ashe, I feel as though it is my responsibility to uphold the strong voices of the Black Bruin community,\" he said. This school has experienced unacceptable instances of injustice recently, and many people are not aware of what is happening at this university.\" In an email statement to the school paper, Janina Montero, vice chancellor of student affairs, said administrators acknowledge the need for more diversity and are attempting to work within the state's admission parameters. In an interview with the Daily Bruin, Stokes said he almost dropped out of UCLA during his first year because he felt isolated and uncomfortable. Although he eventually found his niche in the minority community, he said he wanted to raise awareness about the school's lack of diversity before the university's application deadline on Nov. 30. \"We had to do something to put our issues on the map,\" Stokes said."}
{"pred": "After all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low. Yet leaving your kid alone, even for a short time in safe circumstances, can lead to a child-abuse investigation. \"People don\u2019t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral,\" the researchers write. To separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1\u20442-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching Frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes. The reasons for the parent\u2019s absence were varied randomly. It could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover. The researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting. The chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually. \"That is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so.\" Only in the past decade or so has \"no child left alone\" become the social and legal norm in the U.S. Indeed, parents safely make decisions every day without thinking about other tiny risks. The real stranger danger doesn\u2019t come from would-be kidnappers. The result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse. You don\u2019t think about whether the store you\u2019re taking your child into might get held up. It\u2019s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere, or even to walk with one across a parking lot, than to leave a kid alone in a well-ventilated car. But it taught Koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances. Ah, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services! The same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally. Because the child\u2019s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical. \"In contrast, parents are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their children to wait in cars, play in parks, or walk through their neighbourhoods without an adult,\" they note. \"A mother\u2019s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother\u2019s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother\u2019s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair,\" they write. That was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral).

The unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn\u2019t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade. \"Parents are not arrested for bringing their children with them on airplanes.

Anti-Media Radio airs weeknights at 11pm Eastern/8pm Pacific. If you spot a typo, email edits@theantimedia.org. After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed \"the toughest sanctions\" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton\u2019s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices. Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband\u2019s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi\u2019s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen. The only \"accomplishments\" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her \"impeccable\" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East. In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them\" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons. Those who argue that we should vote for Clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided. Yes, for decades if not longer elections in the United State have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse. But, not this time. Hillary Clinton is simply as terrible as Donald Trump, if not worse. Expect new catastrophic wars in the Middle East, especially one with Iran, if she is elected. Clinton\u2019s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran\u2019s hardliners. By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States. But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, \"ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.\" So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel\u2019s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel\u2019s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran\u2019s number one enemy in the US political establishment. Even though Clinton\u2019s most important \"accomplishment\" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention,\" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran\u2019s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran\u2019s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran. In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors. For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do. So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs. Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran. Why is Mrs. Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons. One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American \"exceptionalism\" and always speaks about \"American global leadership,\" which only means world dominance. She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East. Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran. Clinton is an Israel \"firster.\" Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as \"safe\" for Israel as possible. Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March. During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders\u2019 suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations. Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, \"This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama\u2019s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that\u2019s been working for the United States.\" This is not surprising. Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran\u2019s hardliners are no exception. Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, \"I don\u2019t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement\" (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will. In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again, (ANTIWAR) Thirteen years of wars in the Middle East, since the illegal and criminal invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, and created millions of refugees. The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives\u2019 enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be. \"We have to send Iran an unequivocal message. There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran\u2019s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them. They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary.\" (emphasis added). Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran. But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies. Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh. In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it, Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed \"dialogue among civilizations\" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not. Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called \"friends of Syria\" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as \"friends of Libya,\" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to. Despite Clinton\u2019s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support. In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed \"dual containment\" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box. When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October \"which enemy are you most proud of,\" Hillary Clinton included \"the Iranians\" among them. This was truly disturbing. Was she talking about 80 million Iranians? If she meant the Iranian government, why did she not say so? Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran\u2019s hardliners? Apparently, Hillary Clinton considers all Iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing. July 1, 2016 | Nick Bernabe The cliche\u0301 in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it. Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the \"Shiite crescent\" \u2013 the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon."}

She and her children desperately needed groceries so they made a quick trip to the store. However, one of her girls accidentally left a light on in the car and they returned to a completely drained battery. \"I must have asked more than twenty people in the course of two hours for a jump,\" she wrote to Frank Somerville, which he shared on his Facebook page. \"They all ignored me. Not even a no. [They] just acted like I didn't exist.\" After Tawny Nelson's car broke down at night in the pouring rain with her four young daughters crying in the back, countless people just drove by as she begged for help. At that moment, a 74-year-old man with a bad limp knocked on the window. He handed her a plate of food and bottles of water for her family and let her know that a tow truck was on its way and that his wife was going to drive them home. The next day, the gentleman returned to her house with a mechanic and they made multiple repairs to her car. As her newborn screamed, her 2-year-old cried from hunger, and her 9-year-old desperately tried to help, Tawny described that she started to break down herself. \"I was bawling and felt like the worst Mom ever,\" she recalled. \"He said that the only payment the older man wanted was for me to never give up and keep being an amazing mom,\" Tawny wrote. \"I've never cried so hard in my life. Things had been absolutely awful, more so than I care to explain, and without knowing us or our situation this kind man helped us in ways he will never know.\" After the kind stranger left, Tawny asked the mechanic if she could set up a payment plan, but he informed her that the man had already taken care of the bill. Tawny is grateful to the man for restoring her faith in humanity when she says she was falling apart. And while she knows that she can never repay him \u2014 he wouldn't even take a hug \u2014 she hopes to one day do for another what he did for her."}

By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don\u2019t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,\" says David. As he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he\u2019s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output. \"We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,\" says David. \"Our hypothesis and what we\u2019ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that\u2019s not even including the volatility premium you\u2019d have to price in to a natural gas plant you\u2019d be building for 20 years. You\u2019ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.\" \"The challenges are working with utilities that aren\u2019t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That\u2019s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You\u2019re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It\u2019s a completely different experience,\" he says. \"That\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It\u2019s that much of a difference. So you\u2019re working with this industry that\u2019s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it\u2019s a powerful force.\" \"What we\u2019re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time,\" says David. \"It\u2019s as simple as the product we\u2019re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy.\" David Amster-Olszewski has a distinctive perspective on the future of energy. He\u2019s the CEO and founder of SunShare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. One word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is \"choice.\" \"I think you\u2019re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can\u2019t be shut off. You can\u2019t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,\" he says. \"So you\u2019ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.\" Yet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power. SunShare started in Colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to Minnesota and New York. The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill."}
{"pred": "Dr Karl: Can you get pregnant during a pregnancy? Featured Stories Additional stories Can humans become pregnant while already pregnant? It's possible, but rare. Can a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? In other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development? Normally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant. It was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then \u2014 while pregnant \u2014 had conceived a second time. In other words, Mrs Grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first. Even so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers. About 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the Australian swamp wallaby. Third, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. These changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall. Anyhow, Ms Grovenburg was pregnant \u2014 but then things went odd: the ultrasound showed two independent babies, each living in their own separate amniotic sac. But one was much larger and more developed than the other. But there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation. Female European brown hares frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant. This means females can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season. Ms Grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child. I might be old-fashioned, but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse as \"a desperate and final attempt\" to get pregnant. The technical term for this is superfetation. In humans, it's possible, but it's very uncommon. The first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg. As the ultrasounds scans mounted up for Ms Grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other. But amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 \u2014 a few weeks apart. The Daily Mail claimed that, in a \"desperate and final attempt to have children of their own\", the couple had given it one last try. Dr Karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation. For humans, more babies each breeding cycle isn't always a plus \u2014 especially if you're trying to get a good night's sleep. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, Aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother's uterus. And he was right. It's a phenomenon known as superfetation, and while it's rare, it can happen. The second barrier is physical: a mucous plug. Almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. This plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg. Aristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares. Superfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature. People don't usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get. Possible superfetation has been observed in cows Now we don't have rock-solid proof that this is what happened. We would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that. These scans would need to document a series of changes \u2014 starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks. If you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC. Two thousand years ago, that great Greek thinker Aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare. A typical case is that of Julia Grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from Arkansas. This is a curious use of the word desperate. It makes you wonder what measures they tried before they got desperate."}

{"pred": "So, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. But how should publishers and news organizations play with it? To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that\u2019s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it. This focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful. Before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that\u2019s already been created. Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts. In taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. In this paradigm, a publication\u2019s staff members chat amongst themselves\u2014for instance, discussing a news event\u2014and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion. Publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path\u2014or at least a dimly lit one\u2014to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. While it\u2019s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising. Now, Facebook has an even bigger, faster-encroaching dog for publishers to grapple with: messaging. The Medium is The (Text) Message Text messages\u2014the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices\u2014more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. It doesn\u2019t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email. Since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you \"like\" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again. Why Messaging Is Different It wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed. These writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news. As in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats. It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to. While potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can\u2019t scale themselves to respond to every user\u2019s question or comment. This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news. By virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. This ongoing memory\u2014coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices\u2014positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger\u2019s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites. While we don\u2019t currently have AI-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it. What\u2019s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on\u2014broadly described as conversational user interface (UI)\u2014is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; \u2018designing\u2019 a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface. Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? Facebook\u2019s Messenger and WhatsApp products now process a combined 60 billion messages a day worldwide. As an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even Facebook. It\u2019s the most widely used smartphone feature in the U.S., and it\u2019s already taking a bite out of social media. As of the beginning of this year, according to Business Insider\u2019s Intelligence Reports, the top four messaging apps\u2014WeChat, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp\u2014have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps\u2014Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram\u2014in their aggregate monthly active users. This type of shift\u2014the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft\u2014could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers. Journalists don\u2019t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold. There are no definitive paradigms yet, so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experiences. This unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user\u2019s preferences. In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages. By virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. Also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list. Text messages also offer a better representation of a person\u2019s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. You don\u2019t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time. Looking to the future, you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend. This intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you\u2019d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were\u2014or perhaps before you even knew you were. This type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which Twitter\u2019s co-founder and Medium founder Ev Williams aptly describes as \"stuck in ... the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want.\" CNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel. Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., \"Kasich\") contained within that original bot message. Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories. The Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber. Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case. While easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that\u2019s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a \"brand building initiative.\" Since the user can\u2019t really interact with the message, at best this experiment\u2019s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text. \"Facebook is a bit like that big dog galloping toward you in the park,\" said the late New York Times journalist David Carr, bemoaning the influence the social media giant has had on publishers\u2019 distribution\u2014and, in turn, monetization. \"More often than not, it\u2019s hard to tell whether he wants to play with you or eat you.\" While Mark Zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical UI rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice. When the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like Siri and Alexa, language is the user experience. Unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots \"all of your features need to be reachable solely through words\u2014so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial,\" explains Matty Mariansky, who created MeeKan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform Slack. This new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services. For instance, Mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request. This rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. According to eMarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that\u2019s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. And that number has grown rapidly since. As of this week, Facebook Messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. At a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on WhatsApp. The current limitations of chatbots haven\u2019t stopped messaging platforms like Telegram, Kik and Facebook Messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like The Washington Post from creating their own homegrown bots. The promise of true AI\u2014an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale\u2014is far too meaningful to give up on. That\u2019s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope Send and Recieve API for bot creators, Facebook has also released Bot Engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions. Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? In its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist. The seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued. The underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven\u2019t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions. AI-powered News In the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story. Facebook Messenger weaves chatbots with friends Forbesbot on Telegram Chatbots Editorial Experiments Cost Center or Revenue Stream? BBC uses Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play To handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can more holistically mimic human conversations. This problem isn\u2019t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, \"We\u2019re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small,\" says Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. \"But driving in central Rome or Moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: What does that hand gesture mean?\""}

{"pred": "Overall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year\u2019s average of $1,051. Of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015. Millennials aren\u2019t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it\u2019s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend. We\u2019re not even into October yet, so there\u2019s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses. And the sooner you start, the more you\u2019ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in December. Even if you\u2019re opposed to buying in October, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash. While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016. Parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves. (The men planning on buying gifts for themselves say they\u2019d spend approximately $400, compared to the average of $242 women say they\u2019ll spend on themselves.) It may feel like it\u2019s too early to even talk about holiday shopping, but in reality, two out of five millennial shoppers have already started buying presents for the holiday season. Some consumers were crossing things off the list before back-to-school shopping even wrapped up. As for where the money is going, millennials are by far the most digitally enabled shoppers, which means it will be another big holiday season for online retailers. \"It really helps to spread out the spending that I want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences I want to give to others,\" says Erin. \"Also, August through February is my busiest time at work. So I make sure I try to cross things off my list early in the process.\" Erin Dunphy, 25, started her holiday shopping this summer. She says it\u2019s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule. Erin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. She puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn\u2019t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. It also spaces out her spending, and ensures she\u2019s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases. In addition, Cyber Monday sales might rival Black Friday sales this year. Of those surveyed, 42% will shop on Black Friday, but 47% will capitalize on Cyber Monday deals. Based on the behaviors of millennial and parent shoppers, it\u2019s not surprising that Cyber Monday will be so big; 58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device. \"For the parents, nana and brother, my fiance\u0301 and I usually split the cost which helps tremendously. Right now I have all the friend presents, my mom\u2019s present and I know what I\u2019m getting for everyone,\" says Erin. \"My fiance\u0301 and I are going to Hawaii on our honeymoon, so we\u2019re getting each other an experience while we\u2019re there, that\u2019s the only one I\u2019m really waiting on.\" Erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she\u2019s completed her shopping. She shops for her immediate family, her fiance\u0301, her fiance\u0301\u2019s parents and her two best friends. \"Most of [my shopping] will be online,\" says Erin. \"It\u2019s just easier that way.

{"pred": "A collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity, and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively. As with virtually all collectibles, the rule isn't absolute. While prices will chase fads for most items, the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value. In fact, for collections past their prime, the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away. As Marsha Dixey, consignment director with Heritage Auctions, explained, value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones. Collections become worthless, she said, when the majority of its pieces become little more than knick-knacks that anyone can get. This also brought prices tumbling back down when those \"collectibles\" were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country. Today, the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price, such as the vending machines listed for over $1,000, but most of those Coke-stamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities, available for $5 here and $10 there... if the seller's lucky. If flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections' value, what causes it in the first place? There must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper. The trouble is that, with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products, there was never any market scarcity to begin with. Unlike collectibles like Hummel figurines, whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less, plates such as centennial and Norman Rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer. Yet perception often lags. When it comes to many collections, people's belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true. What drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring, and what can bring that tumbling back down to Earth? To understand that, it's helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less, sometimes a lot less, than many people think. For the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time. No matter how high profile, most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities, remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place. Although billed as a collector's item, these are products that never had any real value to begin with. Today, as the eBay listings show, these are all but worthless, with products such as the Statute of Liberty Centennial Plate selling for $0.99 and most Norman Rockwell ones going for $5 to $15 apiece. By the time 99% of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them, it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts. \"What things don't have a value anymore that people think should,\" she said. \"is one of those things that's totally driven by the collector group that's no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace.\" Like with Thomas Kinkade's work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market. The value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights. Entire books have been written on the Beanie Bubble, but suffice to say that unless you're sitting on one of the Princess Diana bears (priced on eBay at an aspirational $343,000 to $450,000), that collection is worth, maybe, the gas money down to the Salvation Army. 10. Coca-Cola Memorabilia As Jim Griffith, an antiquarian and the dean of education for eBay, explained, a few rules guide the price of collectibles. First and foremost is the oldest of all: supply and demand. \"The frenzy of buying American collectibles and American antiques from the mid- and early-century definitely has taken a downturn,\" Griffith said. it was an investment, projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade. Our father capitulated and bought us each a Britannia bear, which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact, reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collector's item. What happened? A combination of the two factors we've already discussed: market glut and the internet. As Kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion. Prices represented how likely you were to find another Kinkade around the block -- \"local scarcity\" as Dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth. The bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick. Once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that T.K.S. Galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time. Cards are another quintessential collector's item. Today much of the collector's world has shifted to trading card games, where the granddaddy of them all, Magic the Gathering, can still command enormous value. (A single card from that game can still fetch upwards of $30,000.) Unfortunately, despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth, the reality is far more mundane. Aside from the highest value items, comic book collections are worth next to nothing these days. (Although Dixey disagreed with that, arguing that comic books \"are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of Chippendale's Furniture.\") What the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand, but also on regional supply and demand. A piece was as valuable as the supply of Roseville pots that the buyer could find, regardless of how many existed in the wide world. When the local antique store has just two pieces in stock, that can drive up some hard bargains. When shoppers can go home and Google up 800 more, not so much... It's not that baseball cards have no value. As long as the sport remains popular, so too will its cards. It's that they have far less value than people assume. While rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle, most baseball cards are worthless. The disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality. Those carefully hoarded collections from their youth, stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years, will fetch... well, maybe the price of lunch. Where supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself, another major factor in eroding value is something brand new: the internet. It's what wiped out collectors of Roseville Pottery, and it will be back later on this list. Few myths are more common than the idea of collecting as an investment. Unfortunately for these ten examples, the bust has come. \"It would be a mistake,\" he said, \"not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically.\" At one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic. Whether it's an old china set, some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the Declaration of Independence, there's always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered. A brief fad, America practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late '90s. For many Millennials, it stands out as the concept of collections as investments-turned-junk bond, and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe (the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars). \"I had some experience oh 15, 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them,\" Dixey said. \"There were some that were indeed rare, and they were bringing lots of money.\" That particular rule hit the market for Coca-Cola collectibles hard. \"I did a lot of time in the '70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell,\" he said. \"What was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was, and there was no real way to argue with them, nothing to point to.\" By its peak, Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries had 350 locations across the nation, before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010. \"One of the things that eBay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market,\" Griffith said. \"Suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed. Prior to the internet and sites like eBay, I could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops, and it was rare. With the internet, I could connect to every piece of Roseville in the world.\" For years, Roseville Pottery was a collecting craze. While the company itself went out of business in 1954, Roseville's work continued to circulate, gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity. Whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers, collectors prized every Roseville find they could claim, and as a result, prices shot through the roof. Nevertheless, plates commemorating ideas such as the Statue of Liberty Centennial, the World Series and Norman Rockwell's paintings exploded as collectibles, often fueled by QVC and late-night television. Today, those posters will go for a few bucks. Baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer, and may someday be back, but for now, few of those cards are much of an investment. Over the course of the 20th Century, Goebel, the parent company that owned Hummel, decided to break that model. Endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value. Hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place. Back in the 1940s and 1950s, America seemingly couldn't get enough of Coke brand merchandise, and the company obliged, pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare, such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets. (Contrary to popular rumor, however, the Smith & Wesson Coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape, not a marketing partnership.) Prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white TV tray they could. The reason goes back to cultural moments. America simply doesn't have the love affair with its pastime that we once did. When baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone, collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone, and prices reflected that. Today, as interested has waned, so too has demand. 4. Commemorative Plates Hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a German nun, Maria Innocentia Hummel. After GI's returned from Germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market. No one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there. Now, to a degree, Kinkade's work was value-driven. His paintings are legitimately attractive, sometimes downright beautiful, and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didn't really exist in popular culture at that moment. Yet Kinkade was a victim of his own success, creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings, complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a $110 million IPO in 1994. \"Then, all of a sudden, some things started coming out of the woodwork,\" Dixey added. \"You go back to the old adage of supply and demand. All of a sudden there's a glut of them and it brings the price down.\" One month later, the company that developed Beanie Babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year... Today, the Britannia Beanie Baby sells for $10 on eBay. 3. Baseball Cards That dream extends into collectibles. From pogs to marbles to Cabbage Patch Kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. For a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations. Most people have heard the name \"Hummel\" before. One of the most popular collectibles in American history, Hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years. Baseball cards, on the other hand, frequently disappoint. 1. Lunch Boxes After all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt? With Americana popular around the same time as Coke-brand merchandise, everyone can picture this mid-century craze: Smallville, U.S.A. houses decorated from front to back with American flags and eagles in every shape, size and permutation. Americana collectors slept under Uncle Sam sheets, ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames. The reason, Griffith explained, has much to do with emotion. It is often, he said, about a \"shared cultural moment.\" Collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse. Hummel represented the end of the war years while Thomas Kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation. For some reason in the mid-century, the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge. 5. Comic Books 6. Hummel Figurines One of the biggest questions in this space is, consistently: why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations. Part of it is simple lack of research, but part, Griffith said, is the very human habit of wishful thinking. On the list of nice dreams, add the idea that the old Fraggle Rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and Gatorade might help send your kids to college. Now dispense with that notion altogether, because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them, these products just aren't that valuable. 7. Thomas Kinkade Paintings 8. Roseville Pottery As Slate's Mark Stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999: \"Those cultural moments change very quickly,\" Griffith said. \"If you think back, it was a year or two ago, the Seth Rogan movie The Interview and all the brew-ha-ha about Sony Pictures not releasing it. That was an interesting cultural moment, it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on eBay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars.\" Historians are still struggling to explain it. \"Almost 20 years ago now, Beanie Babies came along ,and it created a furor,\" Dixey said. \"It started at a price point where people could afford to buy it... and then it escalated.\" The Britannia bear wasn't just a toy, we explained \"There is no greater evidence of that,\" Griffith said, \"than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media. The idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that today's audience were all comic book readers when they were younger.\" 2. Beanie Babies Another success story brought low by the internet, for a period of time in the '80s and '90s, Thomas Kinkade, the \"Painter of Light,\" was absolutely everywhere. Today? Not so much. 9. Americana Until the internet came along and put a stop to all that, by taking the mystery out of the pot. Dixey had a front row seat for the Beanie Baby explosion. Today, increasingly, the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information."}
{"pred": "Ikhbariya TV also claimed that the rebels tried to take with them captives they had seized and were holding in the rebel enclave. In the central province of Hama, buses and ambulances were waiting to evacuate thousands of people from two Shia villages besieged by rebels, a last-minute condition which became part of the ceasefire deal for Aleppo. He estimated there are 80,000 to 100,000 individuals who would like to leave Aleppo under the ceasefire deal which Turkey helped broker. Meanwhile, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he and his Turkish counterpart are working to launch a new round of peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition \u2014 negotiations which would take place in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, Astana. Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV said buses which were parked at the Ramouseh crossing point in southern Aleppo had left the area after it was targeted by gunmen. It also cited previous reasons given for the suspension of the evacuation: that rebels had sought to take prisoners with them and had bombarded a road due to be used by the buses set to conduct the evacuation from the two villages, al-Foua and Kefraya. Mr Kaynak said there had been a discussion with Syrian opposition forces over the possibility of establishing a centre \"within a security zone in Syria\". He told the private Dogan news agency that \"Idlib has no physical capacity to accommodate so many people\". Deputy prime minister Veysi Kaynak said on Friday that \"20 buses from Aleppo have reached the safe zone under control of the Free Syrian Army in Idlib\". He said 30-35 injured people were being treated at the Sahra hospital just over the border. However, a military news service run by Lebanon\u2019s pro-Damascus Hizbullah group said the evacuation had been halted partly due to a failure to evacuate wounded people from two Shia villages besieged by rebels in Idlib. Hizbullah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Shia group, is fighting on the side of president Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s civil war. It was not immediately clear how long the suspension, which was announced within a couple of hours after the evacuations resumed on Friday, would last. It was not immediately clear if western-backed Syrian opposition would accept such a location for peace talks with Mr Assad\u2019s government. A Turkish official said his country\u2019s aid organisations are helping Syrians who have been evacuated from Aleppo to a border area held by the opposition in Syria\u2019s Idlib province. Mr Putin, speaking during on a visit to Japan on Friday, said Ankara had helped to broker the rebel exit from Aleppo that is currently under way. He said he and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also working for an overall truce in Syria. (AP) \u2013 The evacuation of civilians and opposition fighters from eastern Aleppo have been suspended after rebels opened fire on a convoy at one of the crossing points of the rebel-held enclave, according to Syrian state TV. The Russian leader said that once the Syrian army secures control of all of Aleppo, civilians will be able to return to their homes. Aleppo Evacuations Halted as Rebels Open Fire on Convoy Iran had demanded that the evacuations from Foua and Kefraya be tied in with the mass movement out of eastern Aleppo. Earlier, Syrian state TV reported that four convoys of fighters and civilians had departed from the rebel enclave on Friday. He added that Turkey is willing to provide assistance to \"legitimate\" Syrian opposition groups to help meet their needs. The minister spoke after visiting the Cilvegozu border crossing with Syria in southern Turkey."}

{"pred": "The Surprising Thing You Never Have To Do In Watch Dogs 2 By Dirk Libbey There's a lot to do inside the San Francisco of Watch Dogs 2. However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

That's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now Pikaqiu Pikachu was originally translated as \u6bd4\u5361\u8d85 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 (Pikaqiu). While the name \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn\u2019t sound the same at all. Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name! Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was \u5bf5\u7269\u5c0f\u7cbe\u9748 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was \u795e\u5947\u5bf6\u8c9d, Magic Babies. With Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see: Well, I guess it was good while it lasted, but apparently all things must come to an end; or quite possibly just a revamped beginning. Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends. Fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation. This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists."}

{"pred": "\"What we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe. It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries. Scientists Have Formulated An Equation To Show Just How Much Damage Humans Are Causing To Earth Planet Earth, they wrote, has proved its resilience beyond doubt as it has for millions of years withstood human meddling with the environment\u2019s most natural state of flux. Having said that, homo sapiens have now reached an era where if we fail to reduce the impact of our activities, then climate change could \"trigger societal collapse\", their research concluded. We\u2019re now living in the Anthropocene Era - where human activity is the primary driver of change to the environment. The impact of capitalist and heavily industrialised societies is equivalent to how an asteroid would impact the planet. \"The human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change.\" Scientists have formulated a mathematical equation to project the mammoth effect homo sapiens are having on the planet and causing irreversible damage to the environment. An equation aids in creating a manifestation of the risks of climate change through large-scale and widespread alterations to the planet. Owen Gaffney and Will Stephen of Australian National University drew up the equation, which was published in The Anthropocene Review journal, by homing in on the rate of change of Earth\u2019s life support system including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterway, ice sheets and other diverse limbs of the planet. Owen Gaffney wrote in the New Scientist, \"For four billion years, the rate of change of the Earth system (E) has been a complex function of astronomical (A) and geophysical (G) forces plus internal dynamics (I): Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun\u2019s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others.\" Steffen says that these forces have changed our natural environment at a rate of 0.01 degrees Celsius per century. However, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years \"have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate\". He added, \"In the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now. All these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact.\" \"We are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence,\" Steffen said. According to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces. \"Crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes. just in"}

The Jake LaMotta biopic Raging Bull credits LaMotta as a consultant and cites his memoir as a source text just minutes before asserting that he is the film\u2019s entirely fictional invention. Virtually every film in modern memory ends with some variation of the same disclaimer: \"This is a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental.\" The cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it. Who knew its origins were so lurid? A justice in the case told MGM that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events. What proved to be MGM\u2019s undoing was its lack of deniability. Unwisely, they\u2019d prefaced the film with this: \"This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive\u2014the rest met death by violence.\" From that, audiences could logically infer that the Yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the Chegodieffs. Yusupov, now penniless in Paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. He argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin\u2014in part because he\u2019d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing Rasputin. He wasn\u2019t wrong: The New York Times, in its review, noted that Chegodieff was \"really intended to represent [Yusupov].\" Irina Yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her \u00a325,000, or about $125,000. MGM had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time. For that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than Grigori Rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate Russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed Romanovs. It all started when an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio\u2019s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin\u2019s murder. And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him. An MGM researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the Yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. MGM was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. If it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around Rasputin and the czarina\u2014about whom there were prurient rumors, which Rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to \"the old girl\"\u2014but MGM couldn\u2019t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles. But having copped to being a murderer, Yusupov couldn\u2019t build much of a libel case. Instead, he alleged that Rasputin and the Empress in fact defamed his wife. In the film, Chegodieff\u2019s wife is \"Princess Natasha,\" a supporter of Rasputin. But the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering Natasha\u2014by his logic, with which she agrees\u2014unfit to be a wife. Yusupov contended that as viewers would equate Chegodieff with Yusupov, so would they link Natasha with Irina. But while Yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, Irina and Rasputin had never met. (The scene also libeled Rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: \"Rasputin sucks,\" \"Rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses,\" etc.) Comedy Central A Slate Plus Special Feature: Radio Drama Has Returned to the Spotlight\u2014Now What?

Sixteen years later, MGM produced Rasputin and the Empress, based on those events. Its big coup was casting the three Barrymore siblings\u2014stars of stage and silent film\u2014in the lead roles. Lionel played Rasputin, Ethel the czarina, and John (grandfather of Drew) was \"Prince Paul Chegodieff,\" a composite, who murders Rasputin. Although the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina. (In doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution.) Here\u2019s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin\u2014the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant\u2014had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him. Poster via Wikimedia Commons"}

A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified \u2013 utterly terrified \u2013 of cucumbers. Cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don\u2019t fully understand, which isn\u2019t really that different from most animals, including humans. It\u2019s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be \u2013 so they\u2019re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn\u2019t helping. But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables? To be fair, there aren\u2019t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it\u2019s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that\u2019s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: \"I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.\" In the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they\u2019re facing the other way \u2013 mostly eating \u2013 and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move. \"Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,\" Mugford continued. \"I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.\" Well, there\u2019s only one way to find out. This is, after all, for science. Get your model spiders at the ready."}

However, there is a set of the population (one that the American Beverage Association is trying to no doubt grow) that believes diet sodas are at least as effective, if not more so, than water in losing weight. The group drinking the water after their meals had a larger average weight loss than those who stuck with the diet beverages, and also improved the water group\u2019s insulin resistance, the benefit of which could be leveraged in various medical treatments. A sample of 89 women who usually drank diet beverages, with BMIs of 27-40 (slightly to moderately overweight), were parsed into two groups: those who would continue to drink diet beverages after eating their lunch and those who would replace their diet drinks with water. They did so five times per week for 24 weeks. This is among the first studies to offer a rebuttal to the ABA-funded study, and it suggests, as many would believe, diet beverages do not beat water when it comes to losing weight. Last year, some surprising news came from a study that suggested diet beverages were more effective in promoting weight loss than water was. Of course, the surprise was lessened by the news that the study was funded in totality by the American Beverage Association, the membership of which includes many soft drink companies. Due to the recency of those findings (they circulated in June 2014), the results haven\u2019t been totally disproven.

{"pred": "Tom Hanks' Riveting Performance Makes 'Captain Phillips' One Of Year's Best So Far Tom Hanks has the scene in \"Captain Phillips,\" a moment that will play during the Academy Awards when Jennifer Lawrence announces Hanks as a Best Actor nominee on March 2, 2014. That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances. That, however, is back-room chatter for another day. For now, just know that \"Captain Phillips\" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. It's riveting filmmaking. \"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\" The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins. This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way. \"Captain Phillips\" opens on Oct. 11."}

Charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits \u2014 some of which dated back nearly three decades. Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said. More than 12,000 kits went untested for years in Memphis, Tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits. In Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and Cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing. Rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA. Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS. Experts say Houston's backlog \u2014 and similar backlogs in other U.S. cities \u2014 are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit, though advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities. Police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases. In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison. One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case. Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested. \"Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. The ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible,\" she said. \"This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,\" Parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results. \"This is not a Houston problem. It's not a Texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years,\" Parker said. JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press ___"}

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn\u2019t have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we\u2019re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn\u2019t our worst fight? What if there\u2019s a worse one ahead of us and we don\u2019t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, 'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn\u2019t get worse.' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage \u2013 an age old trick \u2013 unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" \u2013 and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization.

But the fashionable garment isn't having quite the impact the editors likely anticipated. When McCarthy's cover debuted last week, critics were quick to point out that the other November cover girls, including Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, were all styled in body-conscious outfits that flashed some skin. McCarthy, on the other hand, was dressed in a coat \"so huge,\" wrote Slate, \"that she could hide her Mike and Molly co-star Billy Gardel underneath.\" Fashion magazines have long been accused of treating their curvier cover models differently than their stick-thin celeb cover girls. Vogue was hit with backlash in 2009 over an Adele shoot that showed her sprawled nearly facedown on a bed, her shape obscured; Vogue UK was faced with similar criticism over its Adele cover in 2011, which zoomed in on the singer's face so closely it cropped out her neck. Today, Elle has responded to the critics, defending its styling choices with the following statement: In fact, Elle faced similar accusations in 2010 with another series of covers. Back then, instead of Melissa McCarthy, Gabourey Sidibe was the curvy girl in the bunch; instead of Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, the other cover girls were Megan Fox, Lauren Conrad and Amanda Seyfried. The latter three were photographed from the knees up, showing off their full outfits, while Sidibe's cover photo was cropped at her chest. \"On all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. We are thrilled to honor her as one of our Women in Hollywood this year.\" Then, just as they did today, the folks at Elle denied any ill intent and said their choices for both photography and fashion styling were purely artistic.

But apart from smelling, microbiologists say there is nothing to worry about from a health perspective if you never wash your jeans. There is no evidence that not washing jeans is hazardous to your health, according to Bernhard Redl, an associate professor in the molecular biology department at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. This generally holds true when your denim is worn under normal conditions, such as everyday street wear. Although not washing your jeans doesn't seem to pose any health risks, the smell could become a problem. Denim-heads have suggested freezing your jeans as a way to kill bacteria and the stench, although there is no scientific proof that this method is effective. \u00a9 Provided by The Independent The argument for not washing your jeans has traditionally been about making your denim last longer -- hot water and detergent can speed up how quickly your jeans fade. \"If you talk to real denim aficionados, they tell you don't wash your blue jeans,\" Bergh said in a 2014 interview at Fortune magazine's Brainstorm Green conference. Levi's CEO Chip Bergh says we should stop washing our jeans because it's good for the environment since it saves water and energy. A few years ago, one of McQueen's students wore his jeans for 15 months straight without a single wash and then tested the level of bacteria on them. The student-teacher team was surprised to find that the unwashed jeans carried nearly the same amount of bacteria as those same pants after they had been washed and then worn for another 13 days. \"I think airing your jeans outdoors in the sunlight would be a more effective method of getting rid of odors and a lot of bacteria,\" said McQueen. \"There are environments where having sterile clothing is important,\" McQueen said. That would be true in a hospital, for example, where clothing can transfer infections. However, \"sanitizing your hands is going to be a more important issue here than washing your jeans,\" she said. Bacteria, skin cells, and sweat are transferred to our pants from our own body but \"skin microorganisms are generally not hazardous to ourselves,\" said Rachel McQueen, a professor of human ecology at the University of Alberta in Canada. McQueen's research focuses on the development and retention of odors in textiles. \"It is clear that freezing does not kill most of the bacteria,\" said Redl, \"but puts them in a dormant state.\" Bacteria stops growing in the freezer, but will become active again once you slip your pants back on and those germs are warmed up by the heat of your body. The freezing myth \"What I found was just normal skin flora,\" McQueen told The National Post in 2011. \"The counts were really, really similar.

{"pred": "The National Safety Council has some advice for how to safely shovel snow: \"Men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls. Snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75 percent of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads,\" they added. Shoveling Snow Can Kill Men, Canadian Study Finds \"We suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with myocardial infarction (heart attack),\" Dr. Nathalie Auger of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center and colleagues wrote. Snow shoveling is hard. It's not a daily activity, and it strains the heart, Auger's team said. People often exhale hard with their mouths closed while lifting a heavy shovel full of snow, a dangerous habit called the Valsalva maneuver, they noted. Do not shovel after eating or while smoking Take it slow and stretch out before you begin Push the snow rather than lifting it If you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel Lift with your legs, not your back Do not work to the point of exhaustion Talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease Stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest It might not only be shoveling that does it. People using snow blowers have also been reported to have higher rates of heart attack, the Canadian team noted. Men are more likely to have a heart attack after a snowfall, and it's probably from the exertion of shoveling snow, Canadian researchers reported Monday. A single day of snowfall raised a man's risk of heart attack by just less than 1 percent, they wrote, and it raised his risk of dying from a heart attack by 12 percent. Eight inches of snowfall raised the risk 16 percent compared to a day in the same month that did not have snow, they reported, and men were one-third more likely to die of a heart attack the day after an eight-inch snowfall, compared to a dry day. They found a slight increase in both heart attacks and deaths from heart attack in Quebec after a storm. The likelihood went up with each extra day of snow, they reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Women were not more likely to either have heart attacks or to die of them after snow, the team found. Using the arms intensively and repetitively, especially while standing upright, can also raise the risk that a piece will break off from a clogged artery, the researchers noted. Cold temperatures make blood vessels constrict, which adds to the danger. The team studied 128,000 heart attack cases between 1981 and 2014, and more than 68,000 people who died."}

{"pred": "Minnesota Wants To Legalize Medical Marijuana, But Police Agencies Are In The Way Minnesota will consider passing legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana, but police agencies are standing in the way. A bill in the state House of Representatives would legalize the possession and use of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for people suffering from a range of medical conditions including cancer, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder or any other medical condition approved by the state Commissioner of Health. The head of one police agency put it another way: He openly admitted that he was worried legalizing weed for medical purposes might make it harder for police to get federal drug war dollars. Minnesota receives millions in anti-drug money from the White House every year, and asset seizures from drug raids have become an integral part of state police budgets, Politics In Minnesota reported earlier this month. This time around, Governor Mark Dayton (D) says he'd sign the bill -- but not without the support of Minnesota law enforcement agencies. So far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill. Their opposition, according to a report in local paper St. Cloud Times, is based on fears that marijuana's medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drug's availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions. Minnesota voters, on the other hand, have shown they overwhelmingly support legalizing medical marijuana in all its forms. A St. Cloud State University poll from last year found 76 percent support for the issue. As a result, Melin has said she may draft a compromise bill to legalize marijuana extracts in pill or liquid form. While such a law would be much more restrictive in terms of which patients could receive cannabis for treatment, some law enforcement agencies have said they might be open to such a measure. There's evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill. A similar effort was approved by the Minnesota House and Senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-Governor Tim Pawlenty (R). \"Obviously any compromise ... [is] disheartening for patients,\" Melin told the La Crosse Tribune. \"But we\u2019re facing reality around here, which is if we can get anything done there\u2019s going to have to be compromise.\" HF 1818 has been referred to the Health and Human Services Policy Committee and is scheduled to have a hearing Wednesday evening. Melin said her compromise bill could be ready as soon as next week. Patients would first need to obtain an ID card by getting written certification from a doctor, says measure HF 1818, which was introduced by Rep. Carly Melin (D-Hibbing) last spring."}

{"pred": "SSB4 Online Lag Fixes And Placebos Super Smash Bros 4 3DS: Multiplayer Lag During Gameplay Is A Consistent Problem, Here's How To Fix It There's no denying that Super Smash Bros 4 on the 3DS is a great game. The release date brought a fighter with many characters, lots of gameplay modes and frantic item-throwing fun. But nothing's perfect -- in the case of Smash Bros 4, the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue. Whether it be local multiplayer in Sm4sh or online, the game stutters early and often. Are you experiencing lag in your online battles in Smash Bros 4? Let us know your experiences below! We began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable. So guys, found out I had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. #smashbros pic.twitter.com/wd5lW2PQnS \u2014 Raymond Lancione (@raylancione) October 7, 2014 Super Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer The game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our Smash Bros 4 fights always take place in Lag City. We got a hint of this when we did our review for SSB43DS but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in Japan. Now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. Boy were we wrong. Having this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like Super Smash Bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. Though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. The sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying. For Glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. Though similar to For Fun, the lag was consistent. If you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free. In a 2nd round of local Smash Bros 4 multiplayer \"testing\" (read: playing in the office, for science!) 2 players was much easier on the system. The most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd CPU player was thrown in the mix. Surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag. Playing Smash with our Bros in person was a different story. For some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. I and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing Super Smash Bros 4. \"Connectivity can depend heavily on location so I really don\u2019t know what to say. At the very least, we\u2019ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. During multi-player, you\u2019re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it\u2019s due to the connection speed. If you play when it\u2019s laggy, then the person you\u2019re playing with will experience the same lag, so it\u2019s best to play when the connection is clear. SSB4: Local Multiplayer Something tells me the new 3DS was made because the current one can't handle Super Smash Bros. This is the first time a Smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . The 3DS charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of Nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. Not to mention OG 3DS owners not getting access to the beloved C-stick. If anyone's having #SmashBros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. \u2014 It was me, Milu! (@miluette) October 6, 2014 Though all in all, Smash players now that the 3DS version isn't the real experience. Having the game with us at all times is nice, but the real showdowns will take place on the Wii U -- in HD and with GameCube controllers in hand. If Nintendo can bring a smooth experience to the full edition of Super Smash Bros 4, fans may be likely to forgive the gaming company. Now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with Louis CK . The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it. Nintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. But what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? Would the PS Vita have these lag issues? Could the Ice Climbers have part of Smash Bros for the iPhone ? (Not that you could ever seriously play Smash on a smartphone, but not the point). The Part Where I Complain About The 3DS Hardware 5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. Having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. Despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds. During development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. It\u2019s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. Free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either.\" During our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home wifi network, Smash Bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). We're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. Without the ability to hit the Home Button we were forced to turn it off. On to For Glory then. We played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. In a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. The same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon Smash session. (Smash bros) (Smash Bros) (Smash Bros) (Smash Bros) (Wordpress)"}

{"pred": "Arizona Senators Want To Make It Easier To Legislate Behind Closed Doors State Sen. Carlyle Begay (D), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told The Huffington Post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. That can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, Begay said. WASHINGTON -- Arizona lawmakers are pushing to provide elected officials with more privacy as they draft legislation because they say the state's requirements for open meetings make it too difficult for them to do their jobs. In fact, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun that the state's open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process. Because officials aren't allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus. That process, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws. Begay said the bill isn't intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss \"unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors.\" The plan, proposed by state Sen. Sylvia Allen (R), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. Arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action. \"It's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier,\" Begay said. \"Right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues.\" Barr added that open meetings laws shouldn't be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult. \"We're all held to a certain standard and I think that's the expectation that we're not trying to decrease transparency and openness but we're leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that,\" he said. \"Efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"Our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible.\" \"It allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"It allows people then to participate in that.\" Dan Barr, a First Amendment lawyer with the firm Perkins Coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input. \"Staff wasn't elected, staff isn't accountable,\" Allen told the Daily Sun."}

Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town\u2019s true whereabouts are geographically impossible. \"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you\u2019re a true \u2018Simpsons\u2019 fan.\" The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family\u2019s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location. In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the \u2018real\u2019 Springfield from \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019\" This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\" Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it\u2019s really an every town. It\u2019s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\" OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn\u2019t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it\u2019s their Springfield.\" And they do.

During a press conference call promoting the series\u2019 new season that began last Sunday, a reporter from MyNewYorkEye bluntly asked executive producer Al Jean, \"Where is Springfield? Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\" Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show\u2019s city] is it\u2019s universal.

{"pred": "If you\u2019re a non-scientist, you might have once asked yourself, propped against the bedhead after disappointingly quick intercourse, how long does sex \"normally\" last? So it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no one \"normal\" amount of time to have sex. The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it. Why do we have sex for so long? As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day? The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period \u2013 using a stopwatch. So what did the researchers find? The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation. The average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes. That\u2019s an 80-fold difference. The other problem is that people don\u2019t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn\u2019t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making. Measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it\u2019s socially desirable to say you go long into the night. I know there\u2019s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we\u2019ll just focus on the time to ejaculation. A scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: What is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time? It didn\u2019t much matter which country the couples came from either \u2013 unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men). Why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. In 2003, researchers showed \u2013 using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) \u2013 that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina. 6/6 Have sex with your iPad thanks to the new sex toy no-one asked for Many of us have become inseparable from our smartphones and tablets, but if you're looking to take the relationship to the next step and actually 'f*ck your iPad', sex toy brand Fleshlight has now made this possible for some reason.

{"pred": "in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally. The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably Ce\u0301sar Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Ko\u0308hler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape \u2013 to forestall future invasions \u2013 before destroying it. The alternative \u2013 clonal selection theory \u2013 says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction. Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013. This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible. The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked The GOD problem In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose. Applications that could save millions of lives. The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn\u2019t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument. In the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her."}

You already know the main details, so here's an anecdote that perfectly sums it up: Here we round up some global options when it comes to festivals you really have to commit to: This is not so much a festival as a temporary city. It's hard to think of a festival more picturesque than this one, which takes place in a dense forest that is lit with neon so as to give it an otherworldly look. Situated in the Rhodope Mountains, this festival is not interested in A-list line-ups but rather providing a means for escapism, with attendees revelling in the wildlife and fauna that covers the site and erecting stages, timber shacks and art installations out wood sustainably sourced from the surrounding forests. Art, spirituality, yoga, music, dance, performance, education and sustainability are the cornerstones of Envision, which is filled with temples and healing sanctuaries. Taking place every two years beside a lake, BOOM celebrates the full moon with a psychedelic maelstrom of events encouraging people to converge and experience an alternative reality. some are about just blowing off some steam built up at work or while studying. The holy grail though tends to be the ones aiming for a deeper experience, that reject the isolation of modern society and cherish togetherness. Surrounded by rocky mountains in the scorched Spanish desert, this festival is so intense it's website comes with not only a survival guide but an 'emotional survival guide'. Also, it throws a pool party for everyone the day after the festival ends. The emphasis here is on art, with the tall trees being utilised to create some stunning installations and nooks, but there is also a packed DJ line-up each year and an enormous stage. Finally, we come to the appropriately named Nowhere. Nowhere \u2013 Spain Meadows in the Mountains \u2013 Bulgaria If the lush rainforest of Uvita isn't enough for you, at sunset the tropical beach of Playa Hermosa opens at this festival, which is all about exploring our fundamental connection with nature. All styles of music can be found but the emphasis is on the electronic, along with talks, group meditation and film screenings. some are about food or culture This year's theme is simply 'play'.

After a while of walking around in the dark she comes upon what looks like this portable toilet out in the middle of nowhere. She thinks to herself, \"I could pee right now,\" walks over to the porta potty and opens the door. Only it's not a toilet. Instead there's a guy standing behind a wooden bar top with shelves of liquor behind him. He smiles at her and says, \"Welcome to the smallest bar in the world, what you like?\" After the initial shock wore off, she steps inside and orders a shot of whiskey. She stayed there for a while, had a couple of drinks, thanked the bartender and then walked back to her camp.\"AfrikaBurn - Tankwa Karoo It claims to be \"an autonomous zone of cognitive liberty\" and therefore is completely free from corporate sponsorship and logos."}
{"pred": "KFC's secret ingredient is 'the most underappreciated spice' in the world KFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows: As great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. Witherly concludes in \"Why Humans Like Junk Food\" that the key to KFC's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and MSG with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness. Colonel Sanders' nephew recently revealed what he claims is the secret recipe for KFC chicken. Although KFC has since denied that this is the exact formula, we assume that it's close. The nephew, Joe Ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub. \"I've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system,\" Witherly said. The upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting. The famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper. \"The main ingredient is white pepper,\" Ledington told the Chicago Tribune. \"I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was. Nobody knew how to use it\" in the 1950s. And that's why 12 million people eat KFC every day. 3 tbsp. white pepper 1 tbsp. black pepper 1/3 tbsp. oregano White pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets. White pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade. \"Wow, that much white pepper?\" he says was his first reaction. 2 cups white flour plus 2/3 tbsp. salt Food scientist Dr. Steven Witherly, author of \"Why Humans Like Junk Food,\" was taken aback when he saw the recipe. 1 tbsp. dried mustard 2 tbsp. garlic salt 1 tbsp. celery salt 1/2 tbsp. basil 1 tbsp. ground ginger 1/2 tbsp. thyme 4 tbsp. paprika \"One of the theories I've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,\" Witherly says. But he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense."}
{"pred": "Then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher\u2019s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It\u2019s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before \u2014 just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I\u2019ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women\u2019s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it. Part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It\u2019s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I\u2019ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I\u2019ve actually heard use the irritating I\u2019m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt \u2014 no homo\") \u2014 before I wallop them over the head. They haven\u2019t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they\u2019ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, \"I wish I had a nickel for every time I\u2019ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\" But I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn\u2019t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation. Well, then. It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners\u2019 self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square. Without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don\u2019t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop\u2019s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area. I was sitting around the fire pit in my backyard with a handful of straight male friends when drunken conversation inevitably turned to sex. The perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let\u2019s call him Freddy, announced something to the effect of, \"Having your prostate milked is awesome.\" I nearly choked on my beer. Someone else chimed in: \"It\u2019s the male g-spot.\" Another head nodded. A female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: \"Yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt.\" Bringing up the rear"}
{"pred": "Bizarre things about the Olsen twins that make no sense With everything from their strange dating preferences, to some questionable business practices, to Mary-Kate's still-unexplained connection to the death of Heath Ledger, the Olsen twins have led bizarre lives since leaving the TGIF lineup. Though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business \u2014 the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. And they don't smile. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. There's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the Olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar Mary-Kate and Ashley's lives have become. Elizabeth Olsen is no long lost twin There's definitely a tongue-in-cheek aspect to the attraction, which is why the curators have also published a companion magazine, which is basically just photos of the paintings with funny captions: \"Here we see an Olsen coming to one of two realizations: that she will have to close a car door herself (for some reason) or that her outfit only works sitting down.\" Hopefully, the Olsen twins are as big a fan of self-deprecation as they are of nicotine. The Olsens are now successful fashion designers. With multiple clothing labels to their name, the twins offer everything from affordable children's clothing all the way up to haute couture. And while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at Walmart, they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a $55,000 pill-covered handbag associated with their label The Row in 2012. Portraying Michelle Tanner on Full House was undeniably the starting point for all of the Olsen twins' fame, but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series, Fuller House, the Olsen twins were the only ones to decline. While it's understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction, it doesn't seem too much to ask for the Olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and co-stars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury. After becoming enamoured with the few details surrounding Mary-Kate's wedding, Olsen enthusiasts Viviana Olen and Matt Harkin decided to open a pop-up museum dedicated to the strange public persona of the twins. According to a 2016 story in The Huffington Post, the venue mostly features paintings of paparazzi photos of Mary-Kate and Ashley hiding their faces, but it also has other wacky features like \"a phone that only takes calls from Candace Cameron Bure offering parts on Fuller House\" and a recreation of Mary-Kate's wedding tablescape of cigarettes. For most of their adult lives, the Olsen twins looked like younger, pint-sized versions of Cameron Diaz, but around November 2014, people began noticing just how different Mary-Kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister. Naturally, the plastic surgery rumors flew, with some gossip sites even claiming Ashley had altered her appearance, too. Alexa, tell the Olsen twins they sound like snobs Actress Elizabeth Olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress \u2014 21 years to be exact. But taking time before diving into the acting world isn't the only difference between Elizabeth and the twins. The Olsen twins were asked by Elle to recommend some Christmas gift ideas in 2014. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they exclusively suggested items from their boutique Los Angeles shop, The Row. The real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items, or more accurately, the lack of prices, since everything was listed as \"price upon request,\" whatever that means. (Expensive. It means very expensive.) It kind of goes without saying that any hope for a normal life gets dashed for people who become millionaires before they can even walk, but Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who famously portrayed Michelle Tanner on the smash sitcom Full House, cranked the dial on their wacky personal lives all the way up to 11. According to court documents obtained by Radar, the twins tried to reach a confidential settlement with the plaintiffs, which would have ostensibly allowed them to avoid the publicity of a trial and the additional shady dealings it may uncover. But in March of 2017, the terms of the settlement were made public, and the Olsen twins agreed to pay $140,000 to the approximately \"180 present and past interns\" who were eligible, according to E! News. After legal fees, that leaves a whopping $530 per intern who allegedly wasted their entire internship on mundane office work and didn't learn anything about fashion. How rude! Are the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious, but surely exorbitant prices, or are the Olsen twins just trying to give Gwyneth Paltrow and her Annual GOOP Gift Guide \u2014 with its similarly market-priced personal submarine \u2014 a run for its money? In 2017, the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the Olsens showed up to the MET Gala (above), where Mary-Kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation. It should be said, however, that the tabloid Life & Style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon (who hadn't treated either twin) about possible work Mary-Kate had done. His conclusion? Smoking and/or bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face. Mystery solved. There are few details about the notoriously press-shy Mary-Kate's wedding, but like many things in the eccentric twins' life, one tidbit leaked from the nuptials left everyone scratching their heads. In a profile in The New York Times about the launch of the Row \u2014 the Olsen twins' super high-end clothing store, Ashley admitted she \"has never purchased anything online,\" while Mary-Kate bought something once \"at an online auction.\" We're just going to assume it was a Jesse & The Rippers CD autographed by John Stamos because that's the only way we'll feel like these ladies are somewhat relatable humans after reading about their ridiculous store. In spite of all the critical panning, Elle claims that the twins' film career raked in a startling $750 million dollars. Call us crazy, but we'd trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch. Olsens to Paltrow: 'Hold our beer' The twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies \u2014 45 to be exact, according to Elle. Their most famous film, New York Minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to co-star Eugene Levy \u2014 yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than $21 million worldwide. It's the same for much of their video oeuvre, which was largely ignored by critics. However, their 1995 collaboration with Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley, It Takes Two, did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Amazingly, Full House and Fuller House creator Jeff Franklin doesn't consider the snub a burned bridge, although he did tell Us Weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show, he's done asking. \"But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It's always open!' on the show,\" Franklin said, adding, \"So that's kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open.\" Where Mary-Kate and Ashley are reclusive and cagey, Elizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person who just happens to act really, really well. Baby sister's resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters. Elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare. She went straight to critically-acclaimed indies, such as Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011), then on to mega-hits such as Godzilla (2014), The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Captain America: Civil War (2016). Her attorney, Michael C. Miller, denied she had anything to hide. \"Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,\" Miller said in a statement. Yeah, Mary-Kate and Ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. Their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. How have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled? Former intern Shahista Lalani spearheaded a class action lawsuit against the Olsen twins' Dualstar Entertainment Group after she felt her duties went beyond the acceptable scope of an internship. According to Page Six, lead plaintiff Lalani and about 40 interns past and present claim they were treated poorly and not compensated for their extremely long hours. Though Lalani admits the Olsen twins were nice during her brief encounters with them, she feels the company the twins built did not handle its interns properly. And she has a point. How do coffee runs, data entry, or making photocopies educate students who are volunteering their time to learn about fashion design? The Mary-Kate - Heath Ledger connection Exactly how much do the Olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare Van Cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards? We'll probably never know, but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around $1. Page Six reported that a source said there were \"bowls and bowls filled with cigarettes, and everyone smoked the whole night,\" which is bizarre, especially since it took place in Manhattan, where for years smokers have been shunned into shameful, huddled groups as far away from the general public as possible. Then again, Mary-Kate married Olivier Sarkozy, a french billionaire, so maybe the cigs and the laissez-faire attitude sort of do make sense. But what about the other details? The reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion. According to show producer Bob Boyett, \"Ashley said, 'I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don't feel comfortable acting,'\" and \"Mary-Kate said, It would have to be me because Ash doesn't want to do it. But the timing is so bad for us.\" Mary-Kate looks...different Clearly, she wasn't referencing Mary-Kate and Ashley, who famously, and hilariously failed at hiding from the paparazzi so often that artist Laura Collins created a whole exhibit around their antics. We know we're going to sound like nagging parents here, but seriously, Mary-Kate and Ashley, would it kill you to be a little more like your sister? Mary-Kate's stonewall tactic eventually worked when the DEA and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into Ledger's death in August of 2008. \"The U.S. Attorney of the Southern District decided not to serve Olsen with a subpoena,\" a source told the New York Daily News, which effectively let Olsen off the hook for any further speculation. Elizabeth is also no stranger to the red carpet and interviews, and she displays a remarkable savvy about how to navigate A-List fame while maintaining her personal life. \"It comes quite easily,\" she told Vogue. \"I don't know if that comes from growing up in LA and having so many examples around me all the time. It's something that I watched people doing well growing up.\" Fuller House remains one pair shy It seems to have been forgotten over the years that Mary-Kate was somehow linked with actor Heath Ledger's death in 2008. While there was never any suggestion of foul play, Mary-Kate's name was involved from the moment the Dark Knight star's body was discovered. When Ledger's masseuse found him unconscious in his New York City home, the first person she called was Mary-Kate, twice, instead of 911. Mary-Kate's Kool wedding At any rate, this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering Mary-Kate's rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene, not to mention Ledger's overdose on prescription drugs. The good news: they only made 12 of them, so not only were their ill-gotten earnings likely capped at $660,000, which, let's be honest, is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune, but also there's a good chance you'll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someone's back in real life. According to the Daily Mail, when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities, Mary-Kate \"sent over her security team who arrived at [Ledger's] flat at the same time as the ambulance.\" Stranger still, multiple news sources reported that Mary-Kate refused to talk to federal investigators about Ledger's death unless she was granted immunity. Why was she so concerned about being implicated for something? Did it have anything to do with Ledger's accidental overdose on prescription pills? They are living pop culture artifacts Page Six also reported that guests, of which there were only 50, \"were required to turn in their cellphones\" before a cocktail reception and indoor dinner at \"a private residence on 49th Street, between Second and Third avenues.\" Actually, that all seems completely in line for a woman who once said, \"We've stayed quite sheltered.\" Okay fine, that was Ashley, but you get our point. The Times story includes the following descriptions about their boutique: \"They convinced Masa Takayama, the renowned sushi chef, to sell them his ceramics,\" and \"Indeed, the store feels more like a tastefully appointed manse than a traditional retail shop, its individual rooms decorated with marquee art (a Basquiat here, a Borge Jorgensen sculpture there) and significant furniture.\"  Banking on bad movies The ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery, but don't worry, because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients they've never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply. Did they build a billion-dollar brand on the backs of overworked interns? That's right, these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion. According to Entertainment Weekly, the must-have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist Damien Hirst, whose pill-centric work was previously featured in some of his other installations, called Pill Cabinets. So you should be sensing a theme here, is what we're getting at. Opioid crisis? What opioid crisis? Cool, so we're guessing no clearance rack, right? How about layaway, because if we can do $5 on that Jorgensen, we'll totally be back next week with the rest."}
{"pred": "13 Pokemon The Designers Just Gave Up On So, we\u2019ve trawled through all six generations of Pokemon to find the ones that are just bad designs. Who ever came up with some of these needs to share what they\u2019re smoking! including a question and exclamation mark. Again, this feels like a feeble attempt to introduce a new Pokemon with not much thought put into it. I\u2019m just waiting for the generation where they\u2019ll add a mysterious set of number Pokemon, which is seeming increasingly likely. With 721 to catch, Pok\u00e9mon fans are bound to come across one or two that are just a bit, well, shit. We\u2019ve all got that one that we just hate, purely because it looks like something they let the work experience kid draw on a Friday evening when nobody else could be bothered. I can guarantee you it didn\u2019t take a whole day to design a ditto, did it? and because it was a terrible ide, to begin with, and they\u2019ve managed to scrape three new Pokemon out of it. This Pokemon that I could get on board with, if it hadn\u2019t been drawn by what appears to be an under-imaginative child. The concept is pretty nice The award for the laziest Pokemon design ever has to go to Voltorb. This electric Pokemon resembles something pretty similar to another element of the game \u2013 it\u2019s just a Pokeball with eyes! Award for the most poorly drawn dragon Pokemon goes to Druddigon. The colours are pretty nasty, and I reckon those blue leaves that are supposed to be wings wouldn\u2019t hold the rest of the weight. I kind of feel sorry for him, being so awkward and all. Looking like Charizard\u2019s unloved cousin can\u2019t be all that much fun. So it just turns into white goods whenever it feels like it purely for the purpose of changing it\u2019s power type. It just astounds me that stuff like this manages to get all the way to the game and TV series without anybody going \"Hang on, has anyone else realised this Pokemon is pointless?\" This Pokemon hasn\u2019t been released yet, but it\u2019s coming up on the Sun and Moon games this year. It\u2019s a haunted sandcastle, but that\u2019s about as much as we know. Another one of those that\u2019s just a bit, why? It\u2019s a haunted coffin with four black spaghetti arms and a face on its forehead. All in all, it just looks a bit silly. In its description on Bulbapedia, it says the Pokemon lives in ruins and can swallow up nearby people. Well, now I\u2019m scared. So we\u2019ll start with the Pokemon that inspired me to write this article because it\u2019s a bloody key ring! For Klefki it might be quite convenient, you\u2019d never lose your keys because they are part of your body. But it does absolutely nothing for me in the design department. There are a couple more Pokemon like this, where it seems as though the design team have sat in the office playing \"Eye Spy\" until they find an object they could attach a personality to it. And of all things, they chose a bunch of keys? Each to their own. Dedenne earned its place because it\u2019s so obviously a failed attempt to recreate the much-loved logo and everyone\u2019s favourite, Pikachu. Everything down to the bright cheeks and zig-zagged tail screams cheap imitation \u2013 and nobody can replace our Pika! Another one of my favourites because it\u2019s just so awful. Yes, as you can see above, it\u2019s an ice-cream cone! The designers thought this Ice Pokemon was such a good idea in fact, that Vanilleuxe is the third evolution (after Vanillite and Vanillish) to be featured in the game. I find this one lazy because they\u2019ve added a scoop of ice-cream to resemble the evolution (similar to Dugtrio, Dodrio, etc.) it\u2019s a Water-type Pokemon with a fish-like appearance, shaped like a heart. So much more could have been done with that brief than what we\u2019ve got! There\u2019s no fins or seemingly anything that could be used to propel the creature through water, and the super-necessary circle below the eye is almost laughable. The lost potential of this Pokemon has landed it on my list. I\u2019m trying to get my head around this one because it\u2019s just such a strange concept. The description of Rotom on Bulbapedia (yes, Pokemon Wiki) goes as follows: The flying alphabet which seemingly has little functions apart from the ability of flight and group telepathy, but there\u2019s 28 of them regardless Druddigon Unknown (Unown) It\u2019s pretty hard to pick the worst of the list, as you can imagine but I think I\u2019ve found it in, Garbador. It\u2019s a literal pile of rubbish from an overflowing black bag. Yeah, you read it right the first time. Its pre-evolution is just a bin bag, not quite yet full enough to split. How do they get away with this?  Garbodor Jynx Voltorb Klefki Sunabaa (Japanese version name)  Cofagrigus Rotom But it keeps happening. Luvdisk Dedenne Vanilluxe It\u2019s quite hard to understand what Exeggutor is all about, considering its predecessor is a row of eggs with a name that connotes to eggs, and then it evolves into some coconut tree. What, how does that happen? I\u2019ve never heard of coconuts hatching from eggs but in the Pokemon world, anything seems possible. What even was this supposed to be in the first place? A terrifying large-bosomed-womanhood made for mankind. Jynx makes my list for being just plain creepy. Exeggutor"}
{"pred": "9 Things Elizabeth Taylor Taught Us About The Art Of Love In honor of what would have been her 85th birthday, here are nine things we learned about love from Liz, the fiercest old Hollywood dame of all.  With her joie de vivre and insatiable appetite for the opposite sex, Taylor had the kind of love life most of us can only dream about. She lived her best life and in the process, taught us quite a bit about relationships before she died at age 79 in 2011. Taylor\u2019s fifth (and sixth!) husband Richard Burton waxed poetic about his wife in his private diaries: Sure, she was married eight times, but there\u2019s no denying that Elizabeth Taylor was a woman who knew how to live and love. \"Women liked her and men adored her \u2014 my husband included \u2014 and her love for her children is enduring,\" Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly after Taylor\u2019s passing. \"People always assume you\u2019re going to carry a grudge, but I don\u2019t do that. We passed through that with time.\" \"I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up,\" Dame Elizabeth once remarked. \"It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get.\" We know the type. Still, if Taylor taught us anything about love, it\u2019s that there are plenty of fish in the sea, so if the person you\u2019re with doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re young or pretty enough, tell them to get lost. \"I\u2019ve always admitted that I\u2019m ruled by my passions,\" Taylor said. No kidding. When it came to love, Liz was insatiable \u2014 so much so that the Vatican accused her of \"erotic vagrancy\" when she took up with Burton, her married co-star in the 1966 film \"Cleopatra.\" After that, the couple lived out a totally epic whirlwind romance: marrying in 1964, making up after epic fights time and time again, and eventually divorcing in 1974... only to remarry in a private African ceremony sixteen months later. \"Maybe we loved each other too much,\" Elizabeth said, as if such a thing were possible. \"She is shy and witty, she is nobody\u2019s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography,\" he wrote. \"She can be arrogant and willful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday\u2019s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!\" Taylor reportedly accepted a pave diamond-heart necklace after one of her legendary screaming matches with Burton. It would have been rude not to accept, right? Disagreements are an inevitable part of any relationship. Taylor and Burton were so prepared for them, they would reportedly rent three suites when they checked into hotels \u2015 one above and another below their own. That way, the couple figured, their neighbors would be spared if one of their infamous lovers\u2019 quarrels broke out. You would think things would have been awkward between Elizabeth Taylor and the late Debbie Reynolds after Eddie Fisher left Reynolds for Taylor (the couple\u2019s longtime friend) in 1959. Instead, the two women remained pals until Taylor\u2019s death in March 2011. But what if a relationship doesn\u2019t work out? We\u2019ve always been partial to Taylor\u2019s advice on getting over someone: \"Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.\" \ud83d\ude4c \"I don\u2019t pretend to be an ordinary housewife. I am not and couldn\u2019t be,\" the mom of four once remarked. And it was true \u2014 the actress was anything but ordinary. While her peers played the perfect housewife in photo spreads for Life and Look magazines, La Liz made no bones about her career ambition and racked up husbands like it was NBD at a time when divorce wasn\u2019t nearly as accepted as it is now. She was seriously a woman before her time. Yeah, we think we could get used to someone fawning over us like that."}

{"pred": "Guy Decides To Explore An Abandoned Building That Turned Out To Be Crack House Have you ever come across an abandoned building and just get the feeling that something amazing could be inside? I do all the time. Taking risks and going places you aren\u2019t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. Now, I\u2019m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. I\u2019m a responsible adult....sometimes. The excitement of the unknown is what drives many people\u2019s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. Maybe you\u2019ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. It\u2019s never the same thing twice though. You really don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re going to find or discover. Well that was the driving force behind a man named Dan Bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. It started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. Check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last. He climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. Inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building. Dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn\u2019t seem to get it off his mind. He starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. This place looks like something out of a horror movie. Pretty damn intense right?! This guy is seriously super lucky. I don\u2019t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead. This building is definitely in the slums. If you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. That right there would have probably be enough for me to say it\u2019s time to go. Luckily Dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway. You can clearly tell he is shaken up by the experience though as he is almost crying by the time he gets outside. He really was lucky to escape with his life. Dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs. When he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn\u2019t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings. Well damn! That\u2019s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! As soon as I saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed. This isn\u2019t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore. Trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. The paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren\u2019t even standing anymore. Every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight. It became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. Apparently \"Tony\" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point. Dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. He had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. As with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step. A tense moment came when Dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. It\u2019s a tense moment in an already tense video. He was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit. Falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. It\u2019s so old the wood is rotting and won\u2019t support the weight it used too. After walking through the upper levels for a bit, Dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors. This would be a turning point in the video. What happens next is something that I would never want to experience. After examining the contents of the container, Dan understandably got seriously freaked out. This was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. People have gotten killed for less. Well guess what? The dealer comes back! The remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. This place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used. Finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise. Just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right. The Snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently. Of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further!"}
{"pred": "The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry. Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project \u2014 if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt. So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of. For years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project. But what if we've got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\" China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam. Pretty controversial ideas, no? \"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\" That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector. That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors. China is too quick to rebalance its services sector HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term. The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast \u2014 not just in the short term, but also in the long term. During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output. So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down. \"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\" \"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies. What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter. \"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries. Reuters Meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues. Work, work, work, work, work HSBC From the note (emphasis added): From the note (emphasis added):"}

According to the vet, the plant the dog was chewing on was deadly water hemlock. In July, the plant thrives in wetlands, marshes and river banks across America, blooming with tiny clusters of white flowers. A few bites of the plant can kill a large dog in less than two hours. A dog poisoned with water hemlock may first appear nervous and pupils will dilate. This will progress to twitching, drooling, convulsions and seizures. If a tiny amount was eaten and dogs survive the toxic effects, they are often left with permanent heart or skeletal muscle damage. If dogs eat too much and don't get medical help quickly, this can be followed by respiratory paralysis and death. The three-year-old Border Collie chewed on some plants as the family took a walk through the Horsetooth Reservoir. Shortly after the walk, the dog didn't look well. He was taken to the vet. If your dog does eat hemlock, it's necessary to induce vomiting and get him to the vet immediately."}

While a few dozen states have laws that try to bind the votes of presidential electors, Texas is not one of them. Suprun would be known as a \"faithless elector\" and while there have been some in previous elections, they have never changed the outcome. He added that the election of Mr. Trump is \"not yet a done deal\" and he urged other electors to \"vote their conscience\" and unify behind a GOP alternative like Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Harvard University law professor Larry Lessig has announced that he will provide free counsel to electors who want to oppose  Mr.Trump, according to Politico. It\u2019s called \"The Electors Trust\" and it will offer a platform for electors to plan how to stop the president-elect.  In an op-ed published by The New York Times, Christopher Suprun, a paramedic in Texas, argued that the president-elect has demonstrated each day that \"he is not qualified for the office.\" Suprun went on to say Mr. Trump \"lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief\" and lambasted him for how he \"urged violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign. He speaks of retribution against his critics.\" Mr. Trump, Suprun wrote, has failed to unite the country as President George W. Bush did after 9/11. Instead, he has ranted and attacked the cast of NBC\u2019s \"Saturday Night Live.\" \"He tweets day and night, but waited two days to offer sympathy to the Ohio State community after an attack there.

There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies. \"What most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the U.S. government if it were released,\" said Declan McCullagh, chief political correspondent for CNET, a CBS company. Much as these tweets provide great fodder for conspiracy speculation, the secret to their meaning is hidden in plain sight. \"Pre-commitment\" in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with.
